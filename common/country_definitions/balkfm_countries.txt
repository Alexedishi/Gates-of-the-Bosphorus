	# Alright relax people, Macedonian isn't defined as a basegame culture by PDX and the argument that Macedonian culture had definitively diverged from Bulgarian during the Victorian Era is a tenous one at best; maybe I'll get around to adding content for this divergence in the far future... or not, I dunno. 
	# And before you ask, yes I've read "On Macedonian Matters." This line of thinking didn't become mainstream until after WWII.
	# Also, not to whataboutism you, but if you're gonna crawl up my ass on this one then please also ask PDX why Montenegrin isn't a basegame culture either. Their divergence from wider Serb culture was readily aknowledged by intellectuals in the 1830s.
	# From a gameplay perspective I would NOT implement either of these as their own cultures. Montenegrins being discriminated by Serbs and Macedonians being discriminated by Bulgarians DURING THE GAME'S TIMEFRAME does not make any goddamn sense.
