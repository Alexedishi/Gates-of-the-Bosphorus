# Important point to make here is that the "Russian," "French," and "English" parties were not political parties as we would envision them today. Their origin lies in the patron-client style politics that dominated Greece in the Kapodastrian era.
# Each one takes their name from the Great Power that they seeked to align the Greek state with. This was dominant over their royalist or liberalist tilt.
# These parties congealed into more tangible forms after the coronation of Otto I and the dismissal of Armansperg. However, these were still political groupings heavily dominated by individual strongmen as opposed to true parties.
# As such, the two ideologies "Bavarocrat" and "Constitutionalist" seek to portray their attitudes towards statecraft, while their diplomatic attitudes are handled by lobby scripting.
