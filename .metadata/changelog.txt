• Third Chapter of Content for Greece:
	-Event "Nationalist Fervor" has been given content and handles triggering the "Military League" vs. "A Cretan Champion." While less dramatic in most games, this ensures that players will have access to Venizelism content.

	-New Event Chain for the "Don Pacifico Affair"
	-Crete Revolt mechanics reworked to take into account Greek radicalism on Crete.
• First Chapter of Yugoslavian Content:

	-20 new events and two journals representing the simmering separatism in the Balkans.
• First Chapter of Romanian Flavor:
	-The Regulamentul Organic: Guide the Romanian Principalities through their transiton from post-Ottoman state & elect a new Hospodar every 7 years.
	-Vanilla Romanian Unification events integrated into this mod.
• Minor Addition for Slovene-Croatian Flavor:
	-The Triune Dream: Minor journal entry to properly form the Triune Kingdom.

• Other fixes/additions:

--Update 2.0.4--
-"The Royal University of Athens" event will no longer occur if Morgenröte is also loaded.
-"Annex Rumelia" button now appears if either Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia are both subjects of the Ottomans, or if both are independent. This is a fallback incase the Ottomans fail the Sick Man journal AFTER the Great Eastern Crisis. It also will not appear if a player is Eastern Rumelia (but why would you do this?).
-Fixed the crisis variables being removed too quickly by a forgotten effect, preventing countries from getting post-Crisis modifiers. (The previous fix exposed this issue).
-Crete's former owner now gets a war goal to reconquer Crete instead of letting them go free after the play.


--Update 2.0.3--

-Fixed an issue where the crisis variables were not properly removed following a Turkish victory
