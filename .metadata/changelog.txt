-Fixed the crisis variables being removed too quickly by a forgotten effect, preventing countries from getting post-Crisis modifiers. (The previous fix exposed this issue).
-Crete's former owner now gets a war goal to reconquer Crete instead of letting them go free after the play.


--Update 2.0.3--
