"One day the great European War will come out of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans" - Otto von Bismark, 1888

Ever noticed that despite being called "the powder keg of Europe", nothing really happens in the Balkans most games?

That's what lead led me to create what's now Greece, Byzantium, & the Balkans Flavor. This mod aims to add historical and pseudo-historical flavor to the nations of the Balkans and Anatolia, along with some alt-history content for Byzantium. The Balkans during this time frame were a mess both internally and externally and this mod strives to bring this struggle to live in Victoria 3. This mod adds several hundred events, dozens of journal entries, decisions, new monuments, and several historical characters to Greece and several Balkan states along with new event chains, dynamic names, and journal entries for Byzantium.

Content for Greece:
The Regency Council: A short event chain showcasing Armansperg's interference in 1836
The Bavarocracy: Guide Greece through the "Bavarocracy" under King Otto up to the election of George I
The Dedilomeni Principle: Establish legitimacy in the democratic process under George I
The Military League: Experience a new series of events and journals through the Military League and the Rise of Venizelos
The Megali Idea: Enforce the Greek state's claims over the Aegean
The Revenge of the Greeks: Gain claims on and spread your influence over Alexander's empire
Greek Nationalism: Establish a discrete Greek identity as a Hellenic, Roman, or Hybrid society

Samos in Submission: Navigate the authoritarian rule of Stefanos Bogoridi and assert the autonomy of the Principality of Samos from the Porte
Greek Separatism: Mechanics to influence Greek radicalism and provoke historical revolts in Epirus, Macedonia, Crete, Smyrna and Cyprus (and annex them diplomatically)

Content for Byzantium:
Greek Nationalism: Start as a Rhomaios country and assert their identity against the tide of Hellenism
The Purple Pheonix: Events and journal entries to reclaim the former Roman Empire
Ability to rebuild the Imperial Palace and the Hippodrome, along with a decision to revive chariot racing (replaces the Olympics)
Cappadocia, Trebizond, & Theodoro as playable tags
Dynamic country names for Byzantium and a game rule to choose between "Byzantine" or "Roman" Empire
Event Option to Elect a Palaiologos ruler during the Greek monarch election event (if you've managed to reform Byzantium already)

Content for Montenegro:
