 # journal entries
 je_turkfm_sick_man_main: "The Sick Man of Europe"
 je_turkfm_sick_man_main_reason: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has fallen from grace. Rocked by revolutions in Greece and Serbia and reeling from the Egyptian Revolt, the authority of the #bold Sublime Porte#! has come into question. With the Empire humiliated by the insults of the Treaty of Adrianople and Convention of Kütahya, many anticipate the imminent disintegration of the Sultanate. The government in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] struggles to defend itelf from the Great Powers, and its #o #tooltip:[GetRawTextTooltipTag('turkfm_balkfm_cultures_concept_tt')] Balkan Subjects#!#! eye their chances to break free from the Empire."
 je_turkfm_sick_man_syria: "Sick Man: Reclaim Syria"
 je_turkfm_sick_man_syria_reason: "In his arrogance, the self-styled Khedive of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, saw the transfer of Syria and the Levant from Ottoman administration to that of Egypt. We must right this assault on the Sultan's authority."
 je_turkfm_sick_man_egypt: "Sick Man: Reclaim Egypt"
 je_turkfm_sick_man_egypt_reason: "Egypt has been an integral province of the Caliphate for centuries. The time has come to bring the ancient Kingdom have under direct administration by the Sultan."
 je_turkfm_sick_man_crete: "Sick Man: Reclaim Crete"
 je_turkfm_sick_man_crete_reason: "The Eyalet of Crete has been illegitimately occupied by Egypt since the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence. Seizing on the Sultan's moment of weakness, Muhammad Ali seized the island and has since refused to to return it to our rightful rule. We can no longer tolerate this insult."
 je_turkfm_sick_man_caucasus: "Sick Man: Reclaim the Caucasus"
 je_turkfm_sick_man_caucasus_reason: "Before the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish Wars, the Caucasus Mountains were firmly within the grasp of the Sultan. However, the Russian Tsars have taken advantage of Ottoman disorder to encroach on our holdings in the region. The Porte must take decisive action lest these lands be forever lost to us."
 
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_main: "The Reorganization of the State"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_main_reason: "For decades, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been in steady decline, with the powers of Europe gawning at its borders and unrest spreading across its minorities. In the face of these threats, Sultan #bold Mahmud II#! championed an era of reform, with the aim of creating a truly centralized bureaucracy to govern and unite the Empire. As western thought begins to permeate [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], the spirit of reform and progress is in the air."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_main_goal: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] has completed #bold #greece 5#! or more#! #bold Tanzimât#! [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_argiculture: "Tanzimât: Argicultural Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_argiculture_reason: "Agricultural and land practices have languished as a result of centuries under Ottoman rule. The Empire is a rural one, sometimes even aggresively so. Reform must come lest the threat of famine and decay continue to take root."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_army: "Tanzimât: Army Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_army_reason: "The #bold Auspicious Incident#! save the instution of the Janissaries dismantled and their leaders expunged from the Ottoman court. Despite this, the army remains woefully disorganized and outdated."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_bureaucracy: "Tanzimât: Bureaucratic Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_bureaucracy_reason: "The "administration" of the Empire can hardly be described as such. Despite several attempts at reform, local beys continue to exercise autonomy, taxes are embezzeled, and justice is informal. The Empire cannot hold itelf together without a central authority."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_economy: "Tanzimât: Economic Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_economy_reason: "Despite centuries of connection to European markets, the Ottoman economy is mostly agricultural. The production of finished goods is relegated to artisans and guilds, and the Empire cannot hope to keep pace with Western production methods."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_education: "Tanzimât: Education Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_education_reason: "As the Empire lurches forward into modernity, the lack of formal educational institutions and widespread illteracy have hamstrung both reforms and industry. While it comes with many risks, the Empire can longer suffer such widespread ignorance."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_millet_reform: "Tanzimât: Millet Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_millet_reform_reason: "The Millet System has served as one of the cornerstones of the Imperial order since the Fall of Constantinople. In practice, however, it is anything but systematic. In providing broad authority to its non-Muslim populations, the Empire has hamstrung its ability to effectively implement and exercise law. While each community may fear the loss of their unique priviliges, we must standarize this practice."
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_security: "Tanzimât: Security Reforms"
 je_turkfm_tanzimat_security_reason: "Policing and Penal Codes are woefully disorganized throughout the Empire. While the Sultan rules by decree and provides security to the areas near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], beyond our capital, local beys and autonomous rulers exercise their own authority over their subjects."
 
 je_turkfm_separatism_main: "The Rise of Nationalism"
 je_turkfm_separatism_main_reason: "The subjects of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] grow ever more rebellious as the ideals of #yellow Nationalism#! take root across the Empire. Already the Empire has been shaken by rebellions in Greece and Serbia, and the Russian Empire has secured seniority in the Romanian Principalities. All eyes now turn to the #bold Sultan#! to bring our [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] subjects to heel.\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\n#bold Current Phase:#!
