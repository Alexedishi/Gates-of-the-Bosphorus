 turkfm.001.t: "The Sick Man of Europe"
 turkfm.001.d: "Across Europe, it is held as a certainty that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in decline. As dissent spreads across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetPowerBloc.GetName], the government in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] finds itself grappling with strife and separatism across the its holdings. Between unruly subjects, undeveloped infrastructure, and ineffective government, the Empire appears like a house of cards, waiting for one last gust of wind before collapsing upon itself."
 turkfm.001.f: "Every year, the European eye turns more towards the [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')]. Like vultures to a corpse, the Great Powers have begun efforts to enforce their designs for the [GetStrategicRegion('region_balkans').GetName] and beyond without regard for the desires of local populations. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has remained defiant, and it will take all we have to stand against the designs of the European empires."
