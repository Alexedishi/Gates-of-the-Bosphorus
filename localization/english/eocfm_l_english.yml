 je_eocfm_the_metropolitan_lands_reason: "In the decades following the Ascension of Christ and the missions of the Twelve Apostles, Anatolia served as the cradle of Early Christianity. We will free these lands from the Saracens."

 je_eocfm_the_orthodox_realms_reason: "In the times of the Empire, it was the Patriarchate of Constantinople that saw the spread of Christianity across the steppes.

Now that we control the cradle of Christianity, we should extend our oversight to the Slavic Orthodox community."

 eocfm_declare_autocephaly_desc: "Once the symbol of unity in the Eastern Church, the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople has increasingly come under the influence of the Ottoman Sultan.

 eocfm_revoke_caesaropapism: "Revoke Caesaropapism"
 eocfm_revoke_caesaropapism_desc: "The act of subjugating the Church has had profound effects. Chafing under the yoke of the state, the Church has lost a lot of its former influence. If we wish, we could restore the independence of the clergy."

 concept_autocephaly: "Autocephaly"
 concept_autocephaly_desc: "While nominally a single ecumenical church, the Eastern Orthodox Church structure is much more decentralized than its Western counterpart in Rome.

 concept_patriarchal_seat_desc: "In late antiquity, the early Christian church was organized into five major regions, each centered on the ancient holy cites of #yellow Rome#!, #yellow Constantinople#!, #yellow Antioch#!, #yellow Jerusalem#!, and #yellow Alexandria#!.

 concept_ecumenical_council: "Ecumenical Council"
 concept_ecumenical_council_desc: "#bold Ecumenical Councils#! are large gatherings of prominent bishops for the purpose of settling religious questions or disputes.

 concept_crusades: "Crusades"
 concept_crusades_desc: "The Crusades were a series of religiously-motivated wars initiated by Western European countries against non-Christians. While popularly conceptualized as centered on reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim rulers, similar religious conflicts saw Chrstian expansion into Scandanavia, Eastern Europe, and Iberia. These wars were generally motivated by a desire for fame from nobles and a desire for indulgences by the commonfolk."
