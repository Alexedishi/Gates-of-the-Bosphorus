 concept_patriarch_authority: "Patriarch Authority"
 concept_patriarch_authority_desc: "While nominally a single ecumenical church, the Eastern Orthodox Church structure is much more decentralized than its Western counterpart in Rome. Every nation plays host to prominent bishops that exert influence over the worship in their domain, sometimes in deviation from the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople. Patriarch Authority represents the state's ability to sway its local bishops into "guiding" their adherents towards the will of the state."
