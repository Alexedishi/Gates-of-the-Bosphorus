 je_eocfm_autocephaly: "Declaration of Autocephaly"
 je_eocfm_autocephaly_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has fought hard to assert its independence despite the designs of the Turk-controlled Ecumenical Patriarch and the Moscow Patriarchate. Our clergy have agreed that the only way to insulate ourselves from their interfere is to craft an autocephalous jurisdiction for our nation.\n\nThe state of schism and administrative disruption caused by this process is reducing our [Concept('concept_patriarch_authority','$concept_patriarch_authority$')] by #red -800#!."

 je_eocfm_the_orthodox_realms_reason: "In the times of the Empire, it was the Patriarchate of Constantinople that saw the spread of Christianity across the steppes. Since the fall of the Queen of Cities, the Rus' barbarians have styled themselves as pretenders to the Patriarchal seat. Now that we control the cradle of Christianity, we should extend our oversight to the Slavic Orthodox community."

 concept_patriarch_authority: "Patriarch Authority"
 concept_patriarch_authority_desc: "While nominally a single ecumenical church, the Eastern Orthodox Church structure is much more decentralized than its Western counterpart in Rome. Every nation plays host to prominent bishops that exert influence over the worship in their domain, sometimes in deviation from the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople. [Concept('concept_patriarch_authority','$concept_patriarch_authority$')] represents the state's ability to sway its local bishops into "guiding" their adherents towards the will of the state."
 concept_crusades: "Crusades"
 concept_crusades_desc: "The Crusades were a series of religiously-motivated wars initiated by Western European countries against non-Christians. While popularly conceptualized as centered on reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim rulers, similar religious conflicts saw Chrstian expansion into Scandanavia, Eastern Europe, and Iberia. These wars were generally motivated by a desire for fame from nobles and a desire for indulgences by the commonfolk."
