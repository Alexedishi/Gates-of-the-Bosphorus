 # montenegro content
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric: "The Prince-Bishopric"
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_reason: "To many, the country of Montenegro seems like a ghost from the distant past. With nation-states to the west and empires to the east, the small nation endures as a reminder of Europe's feudal past. The ascent of Petar II to the throne has finally heralded change in the Prince-Bishopric. Invigorated by the ideals of his father, Petar I, and by liberalism from the West, the young Bishop hopes to bring the light of modernity to Montenegro."
 je_balkfm_mon_montenegrin_frontiers: "The Montenegrin Frontiers"
 je_balkfm_mon_montenegrin_frontiers_reason: "When the Seljuks stormed across the Hellespont and laid waste to the Byzantine Empire, the small Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro held out. First aided by the Papacy, and now by Austria and Russia, the small country has endured through the centuries as a bastion of independent Christian rule in the Balkans.\n\nHowever, as their authority over the Balkans continues to disintegrate, the Sublime Porte has embarked on a series of violent actions against the Southern Slavs. Separated from the greater Serb community, many feel that Montenegro is destined for doom lest it manage to secure the border with the Ottomans."
 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform: "Societal Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform_reason: "Montenegro is dominated by its feudal station. In the foothills of the Black Mountain, the people practice the same agriculture that has been in place since the Byzantine times. Industry is totally absent and the peasantry remain tied to their lords and cheiftans. The Bishop hopes to elevate the country from this pitiful state."
 je_balkfm_mon_administration: "Administrative Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_administration_reason: "The Prince-Bishop rules with absolute authority. However, there is little formal structure to the Montenegrin government. While the Bishop selects his ministers, there is no legal system to enforce standards of law and taxation with much of this being handled at the local level by chieftans and tribunals. Petar I's grand vision for Montenegro will never come to pass unless the country can first establish control over its own people."
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform: "Military Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform_reason: "The Montenegrin military can hardly be described as such. With the country trapped in its medieval condition, the state has no formal military units to call on for defense. Ottoman Viziers raid our border towns and the defense of the realm has fallen to tribal chiefs whose loyalty to the Bishop can be described as fractious at best. Montenegro's days are numbered unless it can find the strength to defend itself."
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor: "In Search of a Benefactor"
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor_reason: "Montenegro cannot hope to suvive should the Porte ever succeed in massing a coordinated attack on the small country. With neighboring Pashas threatening the security of our border towns, leaders have suggested that we seek the protection of the European powers. The court has recommended reviving our ancient alliance with Russia, while others have suggested that we seek warmer relations with our Austrian neighbors."
 
 je_balkfm_mon_ali_pasha: "The Wrath of Ali Pasha"
 je_balkfm_mon_ali_pasha_reason: "#yellow Montenegro#! has been set upon by the Vizier of Herzegovina, #yellow Ali Pasha Rizvanbegović#!. Determined to increase their influence in the eyes of the Porte, both Ali Pasha and #yellow Osman Pasha Skopljak#!, the Vizier of Scutari, have committed themselves to finally bringing Montenegro into the holdings of the #yellow Ottoman Empire#!. Every day, reports come in of new atrocities at our borders. It is all we can do to hold out against their aggression."
 je_balkfm_mon_ali_pasha_tt: "Montenegro has weathered #yellow Ali Pasha's#! aggression."
 je_balkfm_mon_black_mountain: "The Black Mountain"
 je_balkfm_mon_black_mountain_reason: "Montenegro, named after the appearance of the mountain Lovćen, clings on by a thread. The Prince-Bishop controls the lands within "Old Montenegro," but the majority of the Montenegrin people live under the thumb of the Turks. Heavily taxed and abused, the Montenegrin Serbs dream of a day when they will be free of the burden of the Porte."
 
 je_balkfm_mon_philosopher_bishop: "The Philosopher-Bishop"
 je_balkfm_mon_philosopher_bishop_reason: "#yellow Prince-Bishop Njegoš#! grew up with the best education the Montenegrin court could afford him, as rudimentary as it was. However, in his youth, he was tutored by Serbian poet #yellow Sima Milutinović Sarajlija#!. It was through his tutelage that Njegoš discovered both a love for literature and his own capacity for writing. Since then, the young Prince-Bishop has striven to document as many of the countless Serbian folk tales as possible.\n\n Following in the footsteps of his father, #yellow Petar I Petrović-Njegoš#!, he hopes to establish a discrete Montenegrin #o Literary Tradition#!.\n\nCurrently, we have #blue [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('manzoni_literary_tradition_var').GetValue]#! #o Literary Tradition#!."
 je_balkfm_mon_epic: "Composing Literary Epic"
 je_balkfm_mon_epic_reason: "The Prince-Bishop has been struck with inspiration once again. Stealing away to his study every evening, he pens fantastical stories blending Montenegrin oral tradition with religious overtones, and nationalistic fantasies."

Seeking both redress and reassurance of the Emperor's support, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has assembled an entourage to accompany him on a trip to Moscow.

 je_balkfm_bul_royal_influence_status: "The Prince has visited Moscow"
 je_balkfm_bul_railways: "Bulgarian Railways"
 je_balkfm_bul_railways_reason: "Support from Russia hinges on the construction of stragetic rail connections to support their influence in the Balkans. Likewise, the British have conditioned their support on the Bulgarian state on buying out several English-operated lines in the region."
 je_balkfm_bul_brigandage: "Brigandage"
 je_balkfm_bul_brigandage_reason: "In the wake of the Greek War of Independence, bandits have terrorized the Balkan countryside outside of the reach of the central governments. Across the peninnsula, people demand they be brought to justice."

 je_balkfm_bul_liberation_of_bulgaria_reason: "Bulgaria has achieved liberty after nearly five centuries of cowering before the might of the Sultan in Tsargrad. Yet, we have been unfairly denied union with the rest of the Bulgarian community. Our brethren in Eastern Rumelia call for freedom from the Sublime Porte."
 je_balkfm_bul_greater_bulgaria: "Greater Bulgaria"
 je_balkfm_bul_greater_bulgaria_reason: "The Treaty of San Stefano stupilated that the Bulgarian state would span across Moesia and Thrace. However, the meddling of the Great Powers resulted in these Bulgar-majority lands being striped away from the state and returned to the Porte."

 je_balkfm_bul_tsardom: "The Bulgarian Tsardom"
 je_balkfm_bul_tsardom_reason: "Followng their arrival in the Balkans, the Bulgarians were Slavicized and established a large domain spanning the north of the region.

 je_balkfm_rom_regulamentul_organic_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] exists only nominally as part of the Ottoman Empire. However, the country's newfound autonomy, both the cities and the countryside remain hopelessly backwards. Disrupted by centuries of conflict along the Austrian Military Frontier and the perennial Russo-Turkish conflicts, the state exercises minimal authority in its rural communities and the economy remains feudal in all but name.\n\nUsing its status as the gaurantor of the Romanian people, the Russian Empire has imposed the#italic  Regulamentul Organic#!, or the Organic Law, upon the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.

 je_balkfm_rom_legal_modernization_reason: "The Romanian people have lacked any form of state governance since the collapse of Roman authority in Dacia.

 je_balkfm_rom_economic_modernization: "Regulamentul: Economic Development"
 je_balkfm_rom_economic_modernization_reason: "As a result of centuries of contest by the major powers of history, the Principalities have lagged far behind their neighbors in development.

 je_balkfm_rom_social_modernization: "Regulamentul: Social Reforms"
