 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric: "The Prince-Bishopric"
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_reason: "To many, the country of Montenegro seems like a ghost from the distant past. With nation-states to the west and empires to the east, the small nation endures as a reminder of Europe's feudal past. The ascent of Petar II to the throne has finally heralded change in the Prince-Bishopric. Invigorated by the ideals of his father, Petar I, and by liberalism from the West, the young Bishop hopes to bring the light of modernity to Montenegro."
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_status: "Guide [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into modernity."
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_tt1: "We have reformed our society"

 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_tt3: "We have organized our military"
 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform: "Societal Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform_reason: "Montenegro is dominated by its feudal station. In the foothills of the Black Mountain, the people practice the same agriculture that has been in place since the Byzantine times. Industry is totally absent and the peasantry remain tied to their lords and cheiftans. The Bishop hopes to elevate the country from this pitiful state."
 je_balkfm_mon_administration: "Administrative Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_administration_reason: "The Prince-Bishop rules with absolute authority. However, there is little formal structure to the Montenegrin government. While the Bishop selects his ministers, there is no legal system to enforce standards of law and taxation with much of this being handled at the local level by chieftans and tribunals. Petar I's grand vision for Montenegro will never come to pass unless the country can first establish control over its own people."
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform: "Military Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform_reason: "The Montenegrin military can hardly be described as such. With the country trapped in its medieval condition, the state has no formal military units to call on for defense. Ottoman Viziers raid our border towns and the defense of the realm has fallen to tribal chiefs whose loyalty to the Bishop can be described as fractious at best. Montenegro's days are numbered unless it can find the strength to defend itself."
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor: "In Search of a Benefactor"
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor_reason: "Montenegro cannot hope to suvive should the Porte ever succeed in massing a coordinated attack on the small country. With neighboring Pashas threatening the security of our border towns, leaders have suggested that we seek the protection of the European powers. The court has recommended reviving our ancient alliance with Russia, while others have suggested that we seek warmer relations with our Austrian neighbors."

First aided by the Papacy, and now by Austria and Russia, the small country has endured through the centuries as a bastion of independent Christian rule in the Balkans. However, as their authority over the Balkans continues to disintegrate, the Sublime Porte has embarked on a series of violent actions against the Southern Slavs. Separated from the greater Serb community, many feel that Montenegro is destined for doom lest it manage to secure the border with the Ottomans. The Prince-Bishop controls the lands within "Old Montenegro," but the majority of the Montenegrin people live under the thumb of the Turks. Heavily taxed and abused, the Montenegrin Serbs dream of a day when they will be free of the burden of the Porte."

However, the country's newfound autonomy, both the cities and the countryside remain hopelessly backwards. Disrupted by centuries of conflict along the Austrian Military Frontier and the perennial Russo-Turkish conflicts, the state exercises minimal authority in its rural communities and the economy remains feudal in all but name.\n\nUsing its status as the gaurantor of the Romanian people, the Russian Empire has imposed the#italic  Regulamentul Organic#!, or the Organic Law, upon the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.
