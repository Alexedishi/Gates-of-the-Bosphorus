 je_great_eastern_crisis_main: "The Great Eastern Crisis"
 je_great_eastern_crisis_main_reason: "The Ottoman Empire is in crisis. Beset with problems from within and without, the Porte struggles to maintain control over the Empire. As nationalism sweeps the country, the state's non-Turkish subjects have begun to resort to armed uprisings with the goal of establishing governments free of Ottomn influence.\n\nLikewise, the European powers have taken advantage of the military and economic stagnation of the Empire to impose their will upon the Sultan. Even now, the court of the Russian Tsar has its eyes fixed upon our lands along the Cascausus and Danube. Unless we are able to stand our ground against European aggression, it is only a matter of time before our Empire will crumble.\n\n#red War is coming, we must be ready#!."

 je_balkfm_the_prince_bishropic: "The Prince-Bishropic"
 je_balkfm_the_prince_bishropic_reason: "To many, the country of Montenegro seems like a ghost from the distant past. With nation-states to the West and Empires to the East, the small nation endures as a reminder of Europe's feudal past. The ascent of Petar II to the throne has finally heralded change in the Prince-Bishropic. Invigorated by the ideals of his father, Petar I, and by liberalism from the West, the young Bishop hopes to bring the light of modernity to Montenegro."
 je_balkfm_the_montenegrin_frontiers: "The Montenegrin Frontiers"
 je_balkfm_the_montenegrin_frontiers_reason: "When the Seljuks stormed across the Hellespont and laid waste to the Byzantine Empire, the small Prince-Bishropic of Montenegro held out. First aided by the Papacy, and now by Austria and Russia, the small country has endured through the centuries as a bastion of independent Christian rule in the Balkans.\n\nHowever, as their authority over the Balkans continues to disintegrate, the Sublime Porte has embarked on a series of violent actions against the Southern Slavs. Separated from the greater Serb community, many feel that Montenegro is destined for doom lest it manage to secure the border with the Ottomans."

 je_balkfm_the_turkish_constitution: "The Turkish Constitution"
 je_balkfm_the_turkish_constitution_reason: "Following decades of political instability and a threated rebellion by fellow war hero Mileta Radojković, the Prince agreed to accept a constitution limiting his power. However, the National Assembly implemented a liberal constitution abolishing Serfdom and providing basic rights to the Serbian people. This proved impalatable to the neighboring authoritarian regimes of Austria and Russia, who found the very roots of their existence threatened by such a radical document. Under immense pressure from within and without, the Prince abolished the Sretenje Constitution after it had been in force for less than a year.\n\nThe Prince now awaits for the National Assembly to produce the new document and seek its approval from our Turkish overlords in Constantinople."
 je_balkfm_the_turkish_constitution_status: "The Assembly is drafting a constitution..."
 je_balkfm_constitutionalism: "Constitutionalism"
 je_balkfm_constitutionalism_reason: "The young Prince appears to be following in his father's footsteps. In spite of his father's exile, he has pushed for a return to autocracy, not knowing that he is eroding what little political support he has. Taking advantage of his political inexperience, supporters of the House of Karađorđević have begun to move against the Prince, seeking to eject House Obrenović from power."

 je_balkfm_the_battenburg_monarchy: "The Battenburg Monarchy"
 je_balkfm_the_battenburg_monarchy_reason: "In the wake of recognition by the Porte, Alexander I was elected with the explicit backing by the Tsar. However, the people have instituted a liberal constitution that runs in conflict with the international intent of having a Russian puppet in the Balkans. The Prince walks a careful line, with further liberal reforms risking his standing with Russia.\n\nThe Prince's ability to retain the throne will be determined by various #tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_battenburg_special_tooltip_advance positive#! or #tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_battenburg_special_tooltip_deplete negative#! conditions. The vehenmently divided National Assembly will only tolerate the Prince so long as he guards liberal ideals and maintains the support of the Russian Tsars."

 je_balkfm_bulgarian_railways: "Bulgarian Railways"
 je_balkfm_bulgarian_railways_reason: "Support from Russia hinges on the construction of stragetic rail connections to support their influence in the Balkans. Likewise, the British have conditioned their support on the Bulgarian state buying out several English-operated lines in the region."
 je_balkfm_brigandage: "Brigandage"
 je_balkfm_brigandage_reason: "In the wake of the Greek War of Independence, bandits have terrorized the Balkan countryside outside of the reach of the central governments. Across the peninnsula, people demand they be brought to justice."
 
 je_balkfm_the_liberation_of_bulgaria: "The Liberation of Bulgaria"
 je_balkfm_the_liberation_of_bulgaria_reason: "Bulgaria has achieved liberty after nearly five centuries of cowering before the might of the Sultan in Tsargrad. Yet, we have been unfairly denied union with the rest of the Bulgarian community. Our brethren in Eastern Rumelia call for freedom from the Sublime Porte."
 je_balkfm_greater_bulgaria: "Greater Bulgaria"
 je_balkfm_greater_bulgaria_reason: "The Treaty of San Stefano stupilated that the Bulgarian state would span across Moesia and Thrace. However, the meddling of the Great Powers resulted in these Bulgar-majority lands being striped away from the state and returned to the Porte."

 balkfm_purchase_rail_desc: "We are obliged by treaty to the British, to purchase the English-owned Rusé-Varna railway. However, Russophiles within the government continue to push that this is a waste of resources that would be best directed at fulfilling Russian demands for rail access."
