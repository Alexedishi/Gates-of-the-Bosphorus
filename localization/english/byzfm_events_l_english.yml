 byzfm.100.t: "The 14 Regions of Constantinople"
 byzfm.100.d: "Constantinople suffered serious decline and depopulation in the decades after the Ottoman conquest. While the city has grown considerably in the last century, this has come at the cost of slums expanding outward beyond the ancient heart of the city. Byzantophile leaders have urged the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to lead"

 byzfm.101.t: "Imperial Palace Ruins Identified"
 byzfm.101.d: "Our engineers' detailed survey has finally been completed and our experts believe the restoration of the Megas Palation, while audacious, is possible.

 byzfm.101.f: ""We rode all along the shore to the palace of Bucoleon, and when he arrived there it surrendered, on condition that the lives of all therein should be spared. At Bucoleon were found the larger number of the great ladies who had fled to the castle, for there were found the sister of the King of France, who had been empress, and the sister of the King of Hungary, who had also been empress, and other ladies very many. Of the treasure that was found in that palace I cannot well speak, for there was so much that it was beyond end or counting." -Geoffrey of Villehardouin, 1204, following the capture of the palace by Boniface of Montferrat"

The restored seat of the Eastern Roman Empire once again looms over Constantinople, evoking the legacy of Constantine and Justinian."
 byzfm.102.f: ""No other place in the empire - or perhaps the world - dripped so extravagantly in gold or boasted so magnificent a display of wealth. Behind the massive golden throne were trees made of hammered gold and silver, complete with jewel-encrusted mechanical birds that would burst into song at the touch of a lever. Wound around the base of the tree were golden lions and griffins staring menacingly from beside each armrest, looking as if they could spring up at any moment.""

 byzfm.103.f: "In the times of the Roman Emperors, the circus at Constantinople, known as the Hippodrome, once held grandiose chariot races for the masses.

 byzfm.104.t: "Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae"
 byzfm.104.d: "Our years of labor and industry have transformed Constantinople from a city locked in a fuedal past into a renewed metropolis in the East. Truly, no other city deserves the title "Queen of Cities" more than the heart of the Greek world."
 byzfm.104.f: "For centuries, Constantinople served as the cradle of Eastern Christianity. Now, the restored city has become a beacon heralding the birth of a new Empire."

At the sound of the gun, the chariots flew across the track, each team urging their horses forward. In the end, the #red Reds#! came out victorious."
 byzfm.110.f: ""As the horses made turn after turn, the crowd roared and the ground trembled. It was as if the Queen of Cities itself had come to life.""

 byzfm.116.d: "Under the summer sun, the great racing factions lined up at the starting line of the great Hippodrome. The circus, packed to the brim with spectators, was alight with the cheers of fans and detractors alike. At the sound of the gun, the chariots flew across the track, each team urging their horses forward. In the end, no team could claim victory after the day's matches.

 byzfm.118.f: "While definitely great entertainment for the masses, this might be a bit... beneath someone of the highest office of the land."
 byzfm.118.a: "Sounds like a sporting idea!"
 byzfm.118.b: "This is hardly acceptable for cultured men."

 byzfm.123.d: "Crowds rushed to the Hippodrome today for an unprecedented sight:\nTo the deafening roar of automobile engines, the people witnessed several automobile enthusiasts careening around the circus, their drivers desperately clinging to their vehicles as they skipped around the packed soil surface of the track. Emblazoning their vehicles with brightly colored logos and sigils, the racers appear to have attempted to make this a motorized equivalent to the chariot race."
 byzfm.123.f: "Despite the lack of organized planning, these hooligans have taken to informal sports such as drag racing and power pulling. Several onlookers have even suggested that these sports be formalized, with the most idealistic even suggesting that smaller vehicles, perhaps derived from gas-driven lawnmowers, could take to the track.

 byzfm.300.f: "Where countless attempts failed over the centuries since the losses of Rome and Constantinople, the Empire stands resurgent today. However, much work remains: numerous Greeks are ruled by heretics and heathens, formerly Roman lands remain within the grasp of foreign pretenders, and countless Byzantine treasures are kept hostage abroad. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] must be sure to live up to the expectations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] subjects if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is to bring glory to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the dream and hope of all Greeks." -I. Kolettis, 1844"

 byzfm.303.t: "The Rome of the East"
 byzfm.303.d: "The ancient heartlands of the Greek people now lie in our control. Prominent voices in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] court call for the return of Egypt and the Levant, once strongholds of Christendom, into the Imperial Ecumene."
 byzfm.303.f: "For over two millennia, Greek culture held sway across the eastern mediterranean. Today, the old Greek cities lie in ruins and the old bastions of Christendom wither under their Muslim holders."

 byzfm.306.t: "Renovatio Imperii Romanorum"
 byzfm.306.d: "As Imperial forces march through the Eternal City, our dream of restoring the Roman Empire has come a conclusion. For the first time in over a millennium, Rome, the Eternal City and the Foremost Seat in the Pentarchy, has been returned to the Empire.

 byzfm.306.f: "The city of Rome was the seat of one of the greatest Empires to dominate Europe. For centuries it has languished in the hands of Lombardic and Gallic pretenders.

Adorned with the reconstructions of the regalia of Byzantine authority, the Emperor stands radiant as a star, ready to lead the Greek Empire forward to the future."
 byzfm.310.f: "Throughout history, from the Greek Plan in the 1700s to the Megali Idea from the 1800s, scholars have envisioned a Greece at the helm of a resurrected Christian Empire in the East. With a native Greek on the throne, this dream comes every closer to becoming reality."

 byzfm.311.t: "A Greek Basileus"
 byzfm.311.d: "As the ascendant Greek state has reclaimed the Empire, both intellectuals and peasants alike have called into question the legitimacy our country being led by a pretender installed by the West."
 byzfm.311.f: "The Greek people have not had a native Greek ruler since the last Byzantine holdouts in the Morea, Theodoro, and Trabzon were overwhelmed by the Turkish advance. While many Greeks would serve as administrators, none would ever claim the position of ruler."
