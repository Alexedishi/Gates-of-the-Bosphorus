 je_grefm_regency_council: "The Regency Council"
 je_grefm_regency_council_reason: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] was still a minor when the Great Powers agreed that he was a satisfactory candidate to rule the reconstituted Greek state. While the young monarch completed his education and began aclimating to his future position, day-to-day administration was delegated to a three-man regency council staffed and funded primarily by Bavarian aristocrats. Following the advice of #yellow King Ludwig I of Bavaria#!, the regents have balked at introducing constitutional governance to the young nation.\n\nAs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] prepares to ascend to the throne in his own right, the prominent regent, [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_landowners',GetPlayer).GetLeader.GetFullName] has centralized the power of the state around himself in a ploy to install himself and his descendants as the rulers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Since taking control of the regency, he has vicously played the fledgling political parties and his fellow ministers against each other, paralyzing all state functions."
 je_grefm_regency_council_tt: "Otto has discharged the Regency Council."
 je_grefm_regency_council_complete_tt: "Triggers the Event #white #bold Discharging the Regency Council#!#!"
 
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main: "The Bavarocracy"
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_reason: "Following the collapse of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government after the assassination of #yellow Ioannis Kapodistrias#!, the [Concept('concept_great_power','$concept_great_powers$')] installed #yellow House Wittelsbach#! as sovereign over the Greek State in the hope of bringing stability to the young nation. However, since taking power, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has conspired to rule Greece by means of absolutism. Meanwhile, both citizens and politicans protest the stagnation and corruption rampant in the nation.\n\nCurrently, the King enjoys #bold #greece [ROOT.GetVariable('grefm_bavarocracy_var').GetValue]#!#! support.\nThis is expected to change by #bold #variable [ROOT.GetVariable('grefm_bavarocracy_progress_var').GetValue|+=]#!#! next month from #tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_sources several factors#!."
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_status: "Guide the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into Liberty or Autocracy."
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_sources: "Current progress change is due to:\n•[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_ruler_popularity_var').GetValue|+=] from the King's popularity.[Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_constitution_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_land_reform_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_brigandage_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_civic_tradition_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_bavarian_auxiliaries_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_heir_faith_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_nikitas_released_type')][Country.GetCustom('grefm_bavarocracy_royal_palace_type')]"
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_complete_tt: "Triggers the Event #white #bold The October Revolution#!#!"
 je_grefm_greek_constitution: "Bavarocracy: Promulgate Constitutional Law"
 je_grefm_greek_constitution_reason: "When the regency council took custody of the nation for the young King Otto, promises were made to produce a constitution that would limit the power of the King and provide good governance to the people. However, since taking the throne, the King has retained power in his court and has refused to call any form of national assembly. Politicians and citizens alike demand the King make good on his word."
 je_grefm_land_reform: "Bavarocracy: Reform Ottoman Land Practices"
 je_grefm_land_reform_reason: "A leftover from Ottoman rule, taxation remains heavily land based with the heaviest burden falling on those who work the fields. While preferred by the noble Phanariotes, this system serves only to hold Greece back from its future."
 je_grefm_brigandage: "Bavarocracy: Stamp Out Brigandage"
 je_grefm_brigandage_reason: "During the 1834 insurrection in Messenia against the regency council, several chieftains recalled veterans of the Greek War of Independence back to service. Following their sudden dismissal, many of these irregular bands have turned to raiding the rural lands of Greece in lieu of the promise of military positions. Despite aid from Bavaria, Brigandage remains a perennial problem in the countryside."
 je_grefm_civic_tradition: "Bavarocracy: Establish a Civil Service"
 je_grefm_civic_tradition_reason: "Since the days of the regency council, the landed gentry have used the lack of constitutional structure to place persons friendly to them in power. This has resulted in rampant corruption at all levels of Greek society."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach: "The Tyranny of House Wittelsbach"
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has declared himself the absolute ruler of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Like his father before him, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] seeks to secure unfettered power over his people. Following a series of royal decrees, the King has disbanded the National Assembly and now directly chairs his privy council, routing all affairs of state through his office.\n\nThis has not gone unanswered and supporters of constitutional rule have begun to rally the people to the cause of democracy. As the clouds of [concept_revolution] grow, it falls to the King to secure the mandate to rule.\n\nThe King must maintain the support of his political clients. Currently, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] enjoys #bold #greece [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_var').GetValue]#!#! support. This is expected to change by #variable [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_progress_var').GetValue|+=]#! next month from #tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_sources several factors#!."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_goal: "Maintain these laws for 5 years without being in a civil war."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_status: "The King has #bold #greece [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_var').GetValue]/100#!#! support."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_sources: "The following sources are affecting monthly progress:\n•[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_support_var').GetValue|+=] from the [concept_clout] of [Concept('concept_interest_group', '$concept_interest_groups$')] in favor of #yellow Autocracy#!.\n•[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_opposition_var').GetValue|+=] from the [concept_clout] of [Concept('concept_interest_group', '$concept_interest_groups$')] in opposition to #yellow Autocracy#!.\n•[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_laws_var').GetValue|+=] from having #yellow Autocracy#!, #yellow Hereditary#! or #yellow Appointed Bureaucracts#!, and #yellow Serfdom#! or #yellow Tenant Farmers#! enacted.\n•[GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_tyranny_popularity_var').GetValue|+=] from the King's popularity."
 je_grefm_bavarian_greece: "A Bavarian Greece"
 je_grefm_bavarian_greece_reason: "After a generation of resistance against the monarchy, the spirit of reform is widespread in Greece. Reformers have demanded that the King be mandated to appoint a government leader with a majority of political power, rather than the leader being chosen by their favor with the King. Meanwhile, monarchists declare that the only way forward is with strong leadership from the crown."
 je_grefm_bavarian_greece_goal: "Maintain these conditions for five years."
 je_grefm_bavarian_greece_tt: "Maintain these conditions for five years."
 
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle: "The Dedilomeni Principle"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_reason: "After two revolts against the monarchy, the spirit of reform is widespread in Greece. Reformers have demanded that the King be mandated to appoint a government leader with a majority of political power, rather than the leader being chosen by their favor with the King."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_goal: "Maintain legitimate rule for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_tt: "Maintain these conditions for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_tt: "This outcome of this journal will vary depending on which group of laws is implemented."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_goal: "Maintain Absolutism or Reform into Democracy."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate: "The Basileùs Autokrátōr"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate_reason: "Byzantium has been resurrected and with it the legacy of four millenia of Greek administrative tradition. As the Greek state reogranizes itself around the imperial court, politicans and citizens alike anxiously await to see what form the Imperial administration will take."
 je_grefm_the_military_league: "The Military League"
 je_grefm_the_military_league_reason: "Motivated by the dream of enosis with Crete and a greater union with Greeks beyond our borders, a band of militarists has hatched a plan to overthrow the government and place themselves in charge. Should they succeed, they intend to reogranize the Greek state to further the cause of the Megali Idea."
 je_grefm_the_military_league_goal: "The Military League is preparing..."
 
 je_grefm_venizelism_main: "Venizelism"
 je_grefm_venizelism_main_reason: "Eleftherios Venizelos is at the helm, and an era of wild change has begun in the Greek state. With the people in a nationalistic furvor, Venizelos and his supporters aim to bring Greece onto the world stage with little to no regard for the whims of the Great Powers. #italic Ankyra! Ankyra!#!"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt1: "Develop Greek Nationalism."
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt2: "Rejuvenate the Government Apparatus"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt3: "Modernize the Military"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt4: "Push Forward Societal Reforms"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt5: "Implement Educational Initiatives"
 je_grefm_venizelism_civics: "Venizelism: Civic Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_civics_reason: "The Greek State has come a long way since independence from the Ottoman Empire. Now, with renewed motivation from Venizelos, the revisionists hope to build the state apparatus into a system capable of rivaling those of Western Europe."
 je_grefm_venizelism_military: "Venizelism: Military Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_military_reason: "Little memory remains of the semi-formal #italic Evzones#! units that were hastily assembled during the Greek Revolution. As planners look forward towards a future in which Greece has a voice in the Balkans, it has become clear that a disciplined and capable army will be essential in securing this outcome."
 je_grefm_venizelism_society: "Venizelism: Societal Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_society_reason: "In many ways, Greek social norms reflect centuries of conservative pressures from both the Ottoman state and the Orthodox Church. Intellectuals argue that Greece must shed these feudal relics in order to leap into the modern age."
 je_grefm_venizelism_education: "Venizelism: Academic Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_education_reason: "While ambitious, the education reforms put forward by the Venizelists aim to bring to the Greek people up to the forefront of academic standards."
 je_grefm_venizelism_constitution: "Venizelism: Constitutional Reform"
 je_grefm_venizelism_constitution_reason: "In the wake of Venizelos' arrival in Greece, the Constituent faction in the National Assembly pushed for the complete abolition of the Monarchy."
 je_grefm_venizelism_humanities: "Venizelism: Supporting Greek Humanities"
 je_grefm_venizelism_humanities_reason: ""
 
 je_grefm_megali_idea: "The Megali Idea"
 je_grefm_megali_idea_reason: "The Greek World once stretched from the hills of the Balkans to the shores of the Levantine Sea. Across the Mediterranean, Greek peoples call for union with the Greek state. We will see the Greek realm restored."
 je_grefm_greater_greece: "Greater Greece"
 je_grefm_greater_greece_reason: "The Megali Idea has been brought to fruition, but only in its most basic form. Several Greek communities still lie beyond our borders. We have an imperative to see to it that our borders grow until every Greek may find shelter within the Greek state."
 je_grefm_grecoturkism: "Greco-Turkism"
 je_grefm_grecoturkism_reason: "Despite the insults we have inflicted upon each other after centuries of Imperial rule, we have determined that the only way forward for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is to embrace the shared hertiage between Greek and Turk. While our cultures are familiar to ech other, this process will take time."
 je_grefm_grecoturkism_goal: "This process will take time..."
 
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism: "Greek Nationalism"
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism_reason: "The Greek people have existed for millennia, yet never has a truly Greek state ever come into existence. From the Greek city-state of antiquity to the multi-ethnic Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, the Greek populace have never held a state that they valued over their own home villages and regions. Spearheaded by Enlightenment thought, movements have sprung up to unite the Greek people under a truly common identity."
 je_grefm_national_language: "A National Language"
 je_grefm_national_language_reason: "Separated by time, distance, and empires, the greater Greek populations have each diverged from the Greek languages that were spoken during the pre-Ottoman times. Scholars today have been engaged in a deep argument whether the Turkic intrusions into the Greek language, or any deviation from Koine Greek, should be tolerated at all."
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal: "The Women's Journal"
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal_reason: "Spearheaded by Kalliroi Parren and backed by the greater Feminism movement, women across the Greek state yearn for better treatment. Historically seen as little more than housewives, women seek their own role in advancing the nationalist cause of the Greek people. The publication, #italic The Women's Journal#!, has acted as a herald for this movement putting forth the ideas that women should own their own property and that children should be taken off the factory floors."
 
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_reason: "The survery of the Corinth Canal is underway. Engineers are optimistic about plans to realize the millennia-old dream of cutting a channel across the isthimus."
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_goal: "Wait for the survey to complete..."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation: "Lake Kopais Reclamation"
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_reason: "The Kopais Plain was a fertile land in antiquity. With our industrial might, we will see it restored to productivity. Currently, we estimate water levels have dropped by #blue [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_lake_kopais_var').GetValue]/3#!."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_goal: "Draining the lakebed will take several years. Events will notify you of progress."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_status: "Reclamation of the lakebed is underway..."
 
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_main: "Greek Separatism"
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_main_reason: "Greek populations extend from their heartlands in Attica, Thessaly, and the Aegean islands to marginal populations reaching into the Levantine and Black Seas. With the rise of nationalism and the Independence of the Greek State, these peoples have begun to yearn for union with the nacent Greek nation. With our support, they may be able to take up arms against their oppressors."
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_crete_status: "The #greece Cretan Revolt#! has #bold #tooltippable #tooltip:[GetRawTextTooltipTag('grefm_crete_progress_tt')] [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_crete_revolt_var').GetValue]/200#!#!#! momentum."
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_sub: "Greek Separatism"
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_sub_reason: "Greek populations extend from their heartlands in Attica, Thessaly, and the Aegean islands to marginal populations reaching into the Levantine and Black Seas. With the rise of nationalism and the Independence of the Greek State, these peoples have begun to yearn for union with the nacent Greek nation. If we fail to keep them placated, they may take up arms against us."
 
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks: "The Revenge of the Greeks"
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks_reason: "The Byzantine heartlands once stretched across both the Balkans and Anatolia. We will restore our dominion over these lands."
 je_grefm_shores_of_phoenicia: "The Shores of Phoenicia"
 je_grefm_shores_of_phoenicia_reason: "Phoenicia, an ancient name for the land known as the Levant, once linked the ancient Greek world to the eastern centers of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Once a part of the easternmost Roman Empire, these lands have languished under centuries of Muslim rulers."
 je_grefm_lands_of_arianon: "The Lands of Arianōn"
 je_grefm_lands_of_arianon_reason: "At the height of Greek influence, two successive Greco-Iranian Empires stretched across the Iranian plateau. It falls to use to reclaim these lands from their Islamic overlords."
 je_grefm_the_graveyard_of_empires: "The Graveyard of Empires"
 je_grefm_the_graveyard_of_empires_reason: "Just over two millennia ago, Alexander the Great's armies thundered across Eurasia, bringing lands past the Hindu Kush into the Greek sphere. For centuries after, Greek kingdoms rose and fell, ensuring Greek influence as far as the Indus River. Even later, the followers of Nestorius brought their heretical teachings to these lands. Now, the Empire will see these lands prosper under the Greek state."
