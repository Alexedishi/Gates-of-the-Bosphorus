 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main: "The Bavarocracy"
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_reason: "House Wittelsbach has conspired to rule Greece by means of absolute power, and both citizens and politicans protest the stagnation and corruption rampant in the nation."
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_status: "Guide the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into Liberty or Autocracy."
 je_grefm_greek_constitution: "Promulgate Constitutional Law"
 je_grefm_greek_constitution_reason: "When the regency council took custody of the nation for the young King Otto, promises were made to produce a consitution that would limit the power of the King and provide good governance to the people. Politicians and citizens alike demand the King make good on his word."
 je_grefm_land_reform: "Reform Ottoman Land Practices"
 je_grefm_land_reform_reason: "A leftover from Ottoman rule, taxation remains heavily land based with the heaviest burden falling on those who work the fields. While preferred by the noble Phanariotes, this system serves only to hold Greece back from its future."
 je_grefm_brigandage: "Stamp Out Brigandage"
 je_grefm_brigandage_reason: "During the 1834 insurrection in Messenia against the regency council, several cheiftains recalled veterans of the Greek War of Independence to service. Following their sudden dismissal, many of these irregular bands have turned to raiding the rural lands of Greece in lieu of the promise of military positions. Despite aid from Bavaria, Brigandage remains a perennial problem in the countrysides."
 je_grefm_civic_tradition: "Establish a Civil Service"
 je_grefm_civic_tradition_reason: "Since the days of the regency council, the landed gentry have used the lack of constitutional structure to place persons friendly to them in power. This has resulted in rampant corruption at all levels of Greek society."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach: "The Tyranny of House Wittelsbach"
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_reason: "The throne has increased it's power against the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people. As radicalism grows in the streets, it falls to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] to secure the mandate to rule."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_goal: "Maintain these laws for 5 years."
 
 je_grefm_megali_idea: "The Megali Idea"
 je_grefm_megali_idea_reason: "The Byzantine Empire ruled the Greek world for nearly one thousand years. We will see it restored."
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_reason: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_goal: "Wait for the survey to complete..."
 
 je_grefm_intro: "Weclome to the Greece & Byzantium Flavor Mod!"
 je_grefm_intro_reason: "This Journal Entry will close itself out, just let it figure itself out."
