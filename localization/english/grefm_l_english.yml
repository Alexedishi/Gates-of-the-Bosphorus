 je_group_grefm_content: "Greece Flavor"
 
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main: "The Bavarocracy"
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_reason: "House Wittelsbach has conspired to rule Greece by means of absolute power. Meanwhile, both citizens and politicans protest the stagnation and corruption rampant in the nation."
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_status: "Guide the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into Liberty or Autocracy."
 je_grefm_greek_constitution: "Promulgate Constitutional Law"
 je_grefm_greek_constitution_reason: "When the regency council took custody of the nation for the young King Otto, promises were made to produce a constitution that would limit the power of the King and provide good governance to the people. Politicians and citizens alike demand the King make good on his word."
 je_grefm_land_reform: "Reform Ottoman Land Practices"
 je_grefm_land_reform_reason: "A leftover from Ottoman rule, taxation remains heavily land based with the heaviest burden falling on those who work the fields. While preferred by the noble Phanariotes, this system serves only to hold Greece back from its future."
 je_grefm_brigandage: "Stamp Out Brigandage"
 je_grefm_brigandage_reason: "During the 1834 insurrection in Messenia against the regency council, several chieftains recalled veterans of the Greek War of Independence back to service. Following their sudden dismissal, many of these irregular bands have turned to raiding the rural lands of Greece in lieu of the promise of military positions. Despite aid from Bavaria, Brigandage remains a perennial problem in the countryside."
 je_grefm_civic_tradition: "Establish a Civil Service"
 je_grefm_civic_tradition_reason: "Since the days of the regency council, the landed gentry have used the lack of constitutional structure to place persons friendly to them in power. This has resulted in rampant corruption at all levels of Greek society."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach: "The Tyranny of House Wittelsbach"
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_reason: "The throne has increased it's power against the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people. As radicalism grows in the streets, it falls to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] to secure the mandate to rule."
 je_grefm_the_tyranny_of_house_wittelsbach_goal: "Maintain these laws for 5 years."
 
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle: "The Dedilomeni Principle"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_reason: "After two revolts against the monarchy, the spirit of reform is widespread in Greece. Reformers have demanded that the King be mandated to appoint a government leader with a majority of political power, rather than the leader being chosen by their favor with the King."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_goal: "Maintain legitimate rule for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_tt: "Maintain these conditions for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate: "A Bavarian Greece"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_reason: "After a generation of resistance against the monarchy, the spirit of reform is widespread in Greece. Reformers have demanded that the King be mandated to appoint a government leader with a majority of political power, rather than the leader being chosen by their favor with the King. Meanwhile, monarchists declare that the only way forward is with strong leadership from the crown."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_tt: "This outcome of this journal will vary depending on which group of laws is implemented."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_goal: "Maintain Absolutism or Reform into Democracy."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate: "The Basileùs Autokrátōr"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate_reason: "Byzantium has been resurrected and with it the legacy of four millenia of Greek administrative tradition. As the Greek state reogranizes itself around the imperial court, politicans and citizens alike anxiously await to see what form the Imperial administration will take."
 
 je_grefm_the_military_league: "The Military League"
 je_grefm_the_military_league_reason: "Motivated by the dream of enosis with Crete and a greater union with Greeks beyond our borders, a band of militarists has hatched a plan to overthrow the government and place themselves in charge. Should they succeed, they intend to reogranize the Greek state to further the cause of the Megali Idea."
 je_grefm_the_military_league_goal: "The Military League is preparing..."
 je_grefm_venizelism: "Venizelism"
 je_grefm_venizelism_reason: "Eleftherios Venizelos is at the helm, and an era of wild change has begun in the Greek state. With the people in a nationalistic furvor, Venizelos and his supporters aim to bring Greece onto the world stage with little to no regard for the whims of the Great Powers. #italic Ankyra! Ankyra!#!"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt1: "Enforce the Megali Idea"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt2: "Develop Greek Nationalism" 
 
 je_grefm_megali_idea: "The Megali Idea"
 je_grefm_megali_idea_reason: "The Greek World once stretched from the shores of the Balkans to the coasts of the Levantine Sea. Across the Mediterranean, Greek peoples call for union with the Greek state. We will see the Greek realm restored."
 je_grefm_greater_greece: "Greater Greece"
 je_grefm_greater_greece_reason: "The Megali Idea has been brought to fruition, but only in its most basic form. Several Greek communities still lie beyond our borders. We have an imperative to see to it that our borders grow until every Greek may find shelter within the Greek state."
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_reason: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_goal: "Wait for the survey to complete..."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation: "Lake Kopais Reclamation"
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_reason: "The Kopais Plain was a fertile land in antiquity. With our industrial might, we may see it restored to productivity."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_goal: "Reclamation of the lakebed is underway..."
 
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism: "Greek Nationalism"
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism_reason: "The Greek people have existed for millennia, yet never has a truly Greek state ever come into existence. From the Greek city-state of antiquity to the multi-ethnic Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, the Greek populace have never held a state that they valued over their own home villages and regions. Spearheaded by Enlightenment thought, movements have sprung up to unite the Greek people under a truly common identity."
 je_grefm_national_language: "A National Language"
 je_grefm_national_language_reason: "Separated by time, distance, and empires, the greater Greek populations have each diverged from the Greek languages that were spoken during the pre-Ottoman times. Scholars today have been engaged in a deep argument whether the Turkic intrusions into the Greek language, or any deviation from Koine Greek, should be tolerated at all."
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal: "The Women's Journal"
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal_reason: "Spearheaded by Kalliroi Parren and backed by the greater Feminism movement, women across the Greek state yearn for better treatment. Historically seen as little more than housewives, women seek their own role in advancing the nationalist cause of the Greek people. The publication, #italic The Women's Journal#!, has acted as a herald for this movement putting forth the ideas that women should own their own property and that children should be taken off the factory floors."
 je_grefm_the_cretan_revolts: "The Cretan Revolts"
 je_grefm_the_cretan_revolts_reason: "The Cretan Greeks have been resisting non-Orthodox rule ever since the island was captured from the Byzantine Empire in the 1200s. With the rise of nationalism across the Mediterranean, it is only a matter of time before they take up arms against us. \n\nCurrently, the revolt has #red [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_crete_revolt_var').GetValue]#! momentum. The next revolt will occur when momentum reaches #bold 150#!."
 je_grefm_the_cretan_revolts_fallback: "The Cretan Revolts"
 je_grefm_the_cretan_revolts_fallback_reason: "The Cretan Greeks have been resisting non-Orthodox rule ever since the island was captured from the Byzantine Empire in the 1200s. With the rise of nationalism across the Mediterranean, it is only a matter of time before they take up arms against us. \n\nCurrently, the revolt has #red [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_crete_revolt_var').GetValue]#! momentum. The next revolt will occur when momentum reaches #bold 150#!."

 # decisions
 grefm_corinth_canal_decision: "Survey the Isthmus of Corinth"
 grefm_corinth_canal_decision_desc: "Since ancient times, the Isthmus of Corinth has linked the Peloponnese from the rest of Greece. With modern innovations in engineering and explosives, we may be able to link the Ionian and Aegean Seas."
 grefm_dismiss_bavarians_decision: "Dismiss the Bavarian Auxiliaries"
 grefm_dismiss_bavarians_decision_desc: "Bavarian soldiers and officers dominate the Greek army, causing discord between them and local recruits. Reformers have called for the expulsion of these units from the Greek armed forces."
 grefm_annex_epirus_decision: "Annex Epirus"
 grefm_annex_epirus_decision_desc: "The Epirote people fought for their freedom from the Ottomans to join the Greek state. We should welcome them into the fold."

 grefm_annex_cyprus_decision_desc: "The Cypriot people have overthrown their Turkish oppressors and call for union with the Greek state."
 grefm_annex_macedonia_decision: "Annex Macedonia"
 grefm_annex_macedonia_decision_desc: "The Macedonian people have earned their freedom from Muslim persecution. They should take their place in the Greek state."
 grefm_annex_crete_decision: "Annex Crete"
 grefm_annex_crete_decision_desc: "The people of Crete have struggled for generations against their Muslim oppressors. We should welcome them into the Greek state."
