 balkfm.100.f: "Every year, the European eye turns more towards the [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')]. Like vultures to a corpse, the Great Powers have begun efforts to enforce their designs for the Balkans against our wishes.

 balkfm.102.f: "The Balkans were closed to the West for over four centuries following the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire. As the Ottoman state continues to backslide, the Great Powers have seized on the chance for diplomatic gains. However, many fear that the disintegration of the Empire may provoke economic turmoil."

 balkfm.103.f: "Informal rebellions have sparked across #yellow Bosnia Vilayet#! ranging from skirmishes with rural bands to fierce fighting with disorganized militias in major cities.

 balkfm.300.t: "A Feudal Relic"
 balkfm.300.d: "For centuries, the Prince-Bishropic of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has succesfully resisted the tide of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]'s expansion across the Balkans. The young Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], inspired by liberalism from the West, seeks to break the Montenegrin state from its feudal mould."
 balkfm.300.f: "While insulated from the Turkish domination of the Balkans, Montenegro is an impoverised, illiterate, and disorganized country. As a relic of a bygone era, taxation is informal, justice is carried out by local lords, and there is little central authority. All the while, the neighboring Viziers of #yellow Herzegovina#! and #yellow Scutari#! eye the Montenegrin lands with glee. Montenegro's time as an independent polity may be numbered."
 balkfm.300.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will find its way."
 balkfm.301.t: "The Light of Modernity"
 balkfm.301.d: "While resisted by the conservative leadership, the Prince-Bishropic has taken the first steps towards moving the country to the modern age. While there is much left to do, with these first social reforms, the people may begin to envision a Montenegrin world that encompasses all Montenegrins that live in the shadows of the Black Moutain."

 balkfm.303.d: "With the approval of Tsar [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName], Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has made a state visit to [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] in the hopes of procuring further aid for the Montenegrin state. However, he has been received cooly by both the Tsar and his court."
 balkfm.303.f: "With the forces of the Porte bearing down on Montenegro, the Prince-Bishop has roused suspicion, both during his journey through Austria and on his arrival at the Russian court. Accused by both of "unmonkly" behavior, a rift has been growing between the feudal Austrian and Russian empires against South Slavic people who look to a future free from Ottoman feudalism."
 balkfm.303.a: "We cannot survive alone."
 balkfm.304.t: "A Professional Outfit"
 balkfm.304.d: "Through the diligent efforts of the Prince-Bishop, the military has been reorganized from a tribalistic miltia hardly deserving the name to a proper extension of state authority."
 balkfm.304.f: "While this will do little to sway the Porte's desperation to retain its grip on the Balkans, at the very least we may be able to stave off their wrath."
 balkfm.304.a: "Excellent news!
 balkfm.305.t: "An Intractable Illness"
 balkfm.305.d: "For several months now, Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has been suffering from a severe cough. After seeing a physician in Cattaro, the Prince has been diagnosed with #tuberculosis#!. The Bishop's condition has only continued to deteriorate since, leading many to worry his time on this earth is coming to an end."
 balkfm.305.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] lacks any physicians of the training required to treat the symptoms of consumption. Hoping to improve his humours, the Prince has devoted more of his time to relaxing and writing."
 balkfm.305.a: "Unfortunate."
 balkfm.306.t: "The Passing of the Bishop"
 balkfm.306.d: "Tragedy has struck [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFirstName] has been found dead in his chambers, his body finally claimed by consumption. The national senate stands divided between [SCOPE.sCharacter('danilo_scope').GetFirstName] and his brother #yellow Pero Tomov#!, with Danilo taking power thanks to popular backing."
 balkfm.306.f: "While vigorous like his father, Bishop [SCOPE.sCharacter('danilo_scope').GetLastName] is young and inexperienced. However, he carries his father's same desire for secular rule in Montenegro."
 balkfm.306.a: "Tragic Circumstances."
 
 balkfm.310.t: "The Principality of Montenegro"
 balkfm.310.d: "Returning from a journey to [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has brought with him not only a mandate to rule the Black Mountain, but also the Tsar's blessing to rule as Prince of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 balkfm.310.f: "This act by the Russian court, in their senior role as protector of the Orthodox peoples, has granted Montenegro it's first secular ruler, officialy separating the administration of the state from that of the church."
 balkfm.310.a: "This is a wonderful day for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 
 balkfm.330.t: "The Battle of Grahovo"
 balkfm.330.d: "The Ottoman Vizier of Herzegovina, [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetLastName], has attacked the border village of Grahovo with the aid of the Vizier of Scutari, [SCOPE.sCharacter('osman_skopljak_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('osman_skopljak_scope').GetLastName]. Despite the valiant efforts of the local militia, the village was ransacked and several civilians have been put to the sword at the command of [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetLastName]. With the northern border poorly defined, political leaders fear that further Ottoman encroachment is imminent."

Under pressure from both [SCOPE.sCountry('balkfm_benefactor_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] to avoid escalating the conflict, the two have agreed to parlay."
 balkfm.331.f: "The following terms have been proposed:\n 1. Displaced residents of Grahovo may return.\n 2. #yellow Jakov Daković#! will become lord of Grahovo.\n 3. Grahovo will resume paying taxes to the Porte.\n 4. All fortifications at Grahovo will be abandoned. \n 5. There will be "eternal peace" between the Turks and Montenegrins. \n 6. Both Mehmed Pasha, vizier of Bosnia, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] will uphold this agreement."

 balkfm.332.t: "Knives in the Dark"
 balkfm.332.d: "#yellow Bishop#! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has found himself at an impasse. A sealed letter arrived this morning from none other than [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! himself. In it, the Pasha has invited the Bishop to a plot to assassinate Bosian lord, [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetLastName], one of the perpetrators of gratutious violence in Grahovo."
 balkfm.332.f: "Ali Pasha, along with other beys, has found his position as vizier threatened by the rise of Smaïl-aga. With his fears validated by [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName], Ali has sought allies in the region. Given Smaïl-aga's notoriety for a series of massacres in Grahovo after the village fell into Ottoman hands, the consiprators hope that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] will be ammenable to their plans."
 balkfm.332.a: "We will have revenge for Gravoho."
 balkfm.332.b: "This is not the company we keep."
 balkfm.333.t: "A Local Collaborator"
 balkfm.333.d: "Following weeks of considerations, advisors have recommended recruiting a local to carry out the act to avoid implicating the Bishop. They have settled on [SCOPE.sCharacter('novica_cerovic_scope').GetFullName], a local vojvoda."
 balkfm.333.f: "Smaïl-aga's son, Rustem-beg has earned the hatred of Montenegrins still under the Ottoman thumb. Known for his alcoholism and gratutious abuses of non-Muslim women in his realm, tribals initally requested the Bishop's permission to assassinate him. A resident of Tušina, Cerović, like many villagers across Montenegro, has held a grudge against Smaïl-aga for the brutality he unleashed on Grahovo. He and his clansmen have accepted the job without hesistation on the condition that they be given leave to deal with Rustem-beg."
 balkfm.333.a: "He seems a fitting candidate."
 balkfm.334.t: "The Demise of Smaïl-aga"
 balkfm.334.d: "With the blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName], a local vojvoda, Novica Cerović, provoked [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#! by refusing to pay tribute. While traveling to exact justice, the Ottoman lord was beset by several tribesmen from the region. After beheading the slain noble, the Bishop has been presented with his head as proof of the act."
 balkfm.334.f: "In authorizing the killing of Smaïl-aga, the tribesman have cleared the way for revenge against the now-unprotected, Rustem-beg. Likewise, the seemingly tribal nature of the murder has absolved the Bishop of any immediate culpability."
 balkfm.334.a: "Excellent. We will see Cerović rewarded."
 balkfm.335.t: "Unintended Consequences"
 balkfm.335.d: "The "sudden" killing of Smaïl-aga has not gone unanswered. [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! has publicly denounced the murder and begun a campaign of punishment along the border. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has once again been put in a difficult position. With the threat of war escalating once more, [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('austria_scope')] have demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities."
 balkfm.335.f: "Ali Pasha has taken advantage of the turmoil caused by Smaïl-aga's murder. Since the plot remains unknown, the Bishop's options are limited without exposing the nature of the plot."
 balkfm.335.a: "Call for negociations."
 balkfm.335.b: "Expose the plot."
 balkfm.336.t: "Duplicitous Diplomacy"
 balkfm.336.d: "At the behest of the Great Powers, a peace has been negociated between #yellow Bishop#! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetLastName]. However, the Pasha has not hesistated to take his chance to gloat at the Montenegrin people."
 balkfm.336.f: ""My lord he has played us for fools!"\nThis sentiment has echoed across the Montenegrin court, as news arrived of the events that transpired immediately after negociations concluded. Ali Pasha, arrogant in his diplomatic victory, had suddenly opened a bag of gold and threw several coins across the floor. In the ensuring rush, several members of our delegation threw themselves to the floor to gather as many as they could for themselves. This embarassing display has brought to light the sheer poverty of Montenegro in comparison to the rest of the Balkans."
 balkfm.336.a: "Never trust a Pasha."
 balkfm.337.t: "The Arrogance of Samïl-aga"
 balkfm.337.d: "In turning a blind eye to the threat posed by [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#!, we have exposed ourselves to a far greater threat. In his arrogance, [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetLastName] has usurped command of Ottoman Montenegro and styled himself as #yellow Pasha#!. The neighboring Pashas [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('osman_skopljak_scope').GetFirstName] have remained silent, awaiting direction from the Porte."
 balkfm.337.f: "The highly decentralized nature of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]" has aided it in asserting control over its broad landscape. However, individual Pashas, especially once influential, would cooperate with or defy the Porte as their needs saw fit."
 balkfm.337.a: "To arms!"
 balkfm.338.t: "Ali Pasha's Demise"
 balkfm.338.d: "Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] received a letter this morning advising that #yellow Ali Pasha#! was executed a few days ago. After running afoul of the Sultan with his ambitions, the Porte dispatched the vaunted [SCOPE.sCharacter('omar_pasha_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow Pasha#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('omar_pasha_scope').GetLastName] from the #o Military Frontier#! to restore central authority in the region."
 balkfm.338.f: "A direct and loyal man, #yellow Ömer Pasha Lütfi#! has already established himself as a capable commander capable of navigating the powderkeg that is the Balkans. Dedicated to serving the Porte, Ömer Pasha has developed a reputation for bringing justice to the established Ottoman nobility whenever their interests do not align that those of the Sultan."
 balkfm.338.a: "Serves him right, but what of this new figure?"

 balkfm.340.t: "The Lands of Montenegro"
 balkfm.340.d: "With the rise of nationalism in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the people have begun to vocalize their desire for union with our Montenegrin countrymen living under Ottoman and Austrian rule."
 balkfm.340.f: "For over a millennium, our people have cultivated the lands in the shadows of Mount Lovcen. As an agrarian people, our ancestors inherited the same farmlands and pastures that had been managed by the Romans before them."
 balkfm.340.a: "These are our lands."

In fact, they have demanded that we avoid aggression in the region lest we provoke a larger conflict."
 balkfm.342.f: "Historical Note: The phrase "Perfidious Albion" applied to all of the Great Powers, not just Great Britain. Both Austria and Russia would repeatedly renew their support of Montenegro in the hopes of gaining a foothold in the Balkans only to withdraw their support whenever a new border conflict threated to escalate into open warfare."
