 balkfm.300.d: "For centuries, the Prince-Bishopric of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has succesfully resisted the tide of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]'s expansion across the Balkans. The young Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], inspired by liberalism from the West, seeks to break the Montenegrin state from its feudal mould."
 balkfm.300.f: "While insulated from the Turkish domination of the Balkans, Montenegro is an impoverised, illiterate, and disorganized country. As a relic of a bygone era, taxation is informal, justice is carried out by local lords, and there is little central authority. All the while, the neighboring Viziers of #yellow Herzegovina#! and #yellow Scutari#! eye the Montenegrin lands with glee. Montenegro's time as an independent polity may be numbered."

 balkfm.310.f: "This act by the Russian court, in their senior role as protector of the Orthodox peoples, has granted Montenegro it's first secular ruler, officialy separating the administration of the state from that of the church."

Under pressure from both [SCOPE.sCountry('balkfm_benefactor_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] to avoid escalating the conflict, the two have agreed to parlay."
 balkfm.331.f: "The following terms have been proposed:\n 1. Displaced residents of Grahovo may return.\n 2. #yellow Jakov Daković#! will become lord of Grahovo.\n 3.

 balkfm.332.f: "Ali Pasha, along with other beys, has found his position as vizier threatened by the rise of Smaïl-aga. With his fears validated by [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName], Ali has sought allies in the region. Given Smaïl-aga's notoriety for a series of massacres in Grahovo after the village fell into Ottoman hands, the consiprators hope that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] will be ammenable to their plans."
 balkfm.332.a: "We will have revenge for Gravoho."
 balkfm.332.b: "This is not the company we keep."
 balkfm.333.t: "A Local Collaborator"
 balkfm.333.d: "Following weeks of considerations, advisors have recommended recruiting a local to carry out the act to avoid implicating the Bishop. They have settled on [SCOPE.sCharacter('novica_cerovic_scope').GetFullName], a local vojvoda."
 balkfm.333.f: "Smaïl-aga's son, Rustem-beg has earned the hatred of Montenegrins still under the Ottoman thumb. Known for his alcoholism and gratutious abuses of non-Muslim women in his realm, tribals initally requested the Bishop's permission to assassinate him. A resident of Tušina, Cerović, like many villagers across Montenegro, has held a grudge against Smaïl-aga for the brutality he unleashed on Grahovo. He and his clansmen have accepted the job without hesistation on the condition that they be given leave to deal with Rustem-beg."

While traveling to exact justice, the Ottoman lord was beset by several tribesmen from the region. After beheading the slain noble, the Bishop has been presented with his head as proof of the act."
 balkfm.334.f: "In authorizing the killing of Smaïl-aga, the tribesman have cleared the way for revenge against the now-unprotected, Rustem-beg. Likewise, the seemingly tribal nature of the murder has absolved the Bishop of any immediate culpability."
 balkfm.334.a: "Excellent. We will see Cerović rewarded."
 balkfm.335.t: "Unintended Consequences"
 balkfm.335.d: "The "sudden" killing of Smaïl-aga has not gone unanswered. [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! has publicly denounced the murder and begun a campaign of punishment along the border. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has once again been put in a difficult position. With the threat of war escalating once more, [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('austria_scope').GetName] have demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities."

However, the Pasha has not hesistated to take his chance to gloat at the Montenegrin people."
 balkfm.336.f: ""My lord he has played us for fools!"\nThis sentiment has echoed across the Montenegrin court, as news arrived of the events that transpired immediately after negotiations concluded. Ali Pasha, arrogant in his diplomatic victory, had suddenly opened a bag of gold and threw several coins across the floor. In the ensuring rush, several members of our delegation threw themselves to the floor to gather as many as they could for themselves.
