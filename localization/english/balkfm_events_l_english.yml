 balkfm.102.t: "The Eastern Question"

 balkfm.102.f: "The Balkans were closed to the West for over four centuries following the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire.

 balkfm.110.f: "International Congresses are a relatively new form of deconfliction in continental Europe. In previous centuries, the majority of post-war resolutions were conducted via written communications directly between royals and diplomatic corps.

 balkfm.116.f: "Russian fears of the British gaining further footholds in Central Asia have long drawn the attention of the Russian diplomatic service.

 balkfm.300.t: "A Feudal Relic"
 balkfm.300.d: "For centuries, the Prince-Bishopric of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has succesfully resisted the tide of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]'s expansion across the Balkans. The young Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], inspired by liberalism from the West, seeks to break the Montenegrin state from its feudal mould."
 balkfm.300.f: "While insulated from the Turkish domination of the Balkans, Montenegro is an impoverised, illiterate, and disorganized country. As a relic of a bygone era, taxation is informal, justice is carried out by local lords, and there is little central authority. All the while, the neighboring Viziers of #yellow Herzegovina#! and #yellow Scutari#! eye the Montenegrin lands with glee. Montenegro's time as an independent polity may be numbered."

 balkfm.301.d: "Pushing against centuries of inertia, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has finally begun to shed its feudal legacy."
 balkfm.301.f: "While resisted by the conservative leadership, the Prince-Bishopric has taken the first steps towards moving the country to the modern age. There is much left to do, but with these first social reforms, the people might begin to envision a Montenegrin world that encompasses all Montenegrins that live in the shadows of the Black Moutain."

 balkfm.302.t: "Centralized Administration"
 balkfm.302.d: "The Prince-Bishop's efforts have given fruit with the birth of the first state-like administration of the country."
 balkfm.302.f: "By wresting control of the fledgling state apparatus from the ecclesiarchy, the Prince-Bishop has begun the process dragging [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] kicking and screaming into the modern era."
 balkfm.302.a: "Justly done."
 balkfm.303.t: "In Search of a Benefactor"
 balkfm.303.d: "With the approval of Tsar [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName], Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has made a state visit to [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] in the hopes of procuring further aid for the Montenegrin state. However, he has been received cooly by both the Tsar and his court."
 balkfm.303.f: "With the forces of the Porte bearing down on Montenegro, the Prince-Bishop has roused suspicion, both during his journey through Austria and on his arrival at the Russian court. Accused by both of "unmonkly" behavior, a rift has been growing between the feudal Austrian and Russian empires against South Slavic people who look to a future free from Ottoman feudalism."
 balkfm.303.a: "We cannot survive alone."
 balkfm.304.t: "A Professional Outfit"
 balkfm.304.d: "Through the diligent efforts of the Prince-Bishop, the military has been reorganized from a tribalistic miltia hardly deserving the name to a proper extension of state authority."

 balkfm.305.d: "For several months now, Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has been suffering from a severe cough. After seeing a physician in Cattaro, the Prince has been diagnosed with #tuberculosis#!. The Bishop's condition has only continued to deteriorate since, leading many to worry his time on this earth is coming to an end."
 balkfm.305.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] lacks any physicians of the training required to treat the symptoms of consumption. Hoping to improve his humours, the Prince has devoted more of his time to relaxing and writing."
 balkfm.305.a: "Unfortunate."
 balkfm.306.t: "The Passing of the Bishop"
 balkfm.306.d: "Tragedy has struck [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFirstName] has been found dead in his chambers, his body finally claimed by consumption. The national senate stands divided between [SCOPE.sCharacter('danilo_scope').GetFirstName] and his brother #yellow Pero Tomov#!, with Danilo taking power thanks to popular backing."
 balkfm.306.f: "While vigorous like his father, Bishop [SCOPE.sCharacter('danilo_scope').GetLastName] is young and inexperienced. However, he carries his father's same desire for secular rule in Montenegro."

[SCOPE.sCharacter('osman_skopljak_scope').GetLastName]. Despite the valiant efforts of the local militia, the village was ransacked and several civilians have been put to the sword at the command of [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#!

Under pressure from both [SCOPE.sCountry('balkfm_benefactor_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] to avoid escalating the conflict, the two have agreed to parlay."
 balkfm.331.f: "The following terms have been proposed:\n 1. Displaced residents of Grahovo may return.\n 2. #yellow Jakov Daković#! will become lord of Grahovo.\n 3. Grahovo will resume paying taxes to the Porte.\n 4. All fortifications at Grahovo will be abandoned. \n 5. There will be "eternal peace" between the Turks and Montenegrins. \n 6.

A sealed letter arrived this morning from none other than [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! himself. In it, the Pasha has invited the Bishop to a plot to assassinate Bosian lord, [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#!

With his fears validated by [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('serbia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName], Ali has sought allies in the region. Given Smaïl-aga's notoriety for a series of massacres in Grahovo after the village fell into Ottoman hands, the consiprators hope that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] will be ammenable to their plans."

 balkfm.333.t: "A Local Collaborator"
 balkfm.333.d: "Following weeks of considerations, advisors have recommended recruiting a local to carry out the act to avoid implicating the Bishop. They have settled on [SCOPE.sCharacter('novica_cerovic_scope').GetFullName], a local vojvoda."
 balkfm.333.f: "Smaïl-aga's son, Rustem-beg has earned the hatred of Montenegrins still under the Ottoman thumb. Known for his alcoholism and gratutious abuses of non-Muslim women in his realm, tribals initally requested the Bishop's permission to assassinate him. A resident of Tušina, Cerović, like many villagers across Montenegro, has held a grudge against Smaïl-aga for the brutality he unleashed on Grahovo. He and his clansmen have accepted the job without hesistation on the condition that they be given leave to deal with Rustem-beg."
 balkfm.333.a: "He seems a fitting candidate."
 balkfm.334.t: "The Demise of Smaïl-aga"
 balkfm.334.d: "With the blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName], a local vojvoda, Novica Cerović, provoked [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#! by refusing to pay tribute. While traveling to exact justice, the Ottoman lord was beset by several tribesmen from the region. After beheading the slain noble, the Bishop has been presented with his head as proof of the act."
 balkfm.334.f: "In authorizing the killing of Smaïl-aga, the tribesman have cleared the way for revenge against the now-unprotected, Rustem-beg. Likewise, the seemingly tribal nature of the murder has absolved the Bishop of any immediate culpability."
 balkfm.334.a: "Excellent. We will see Cerović rewarded."
 balkfm.335.t: "Unintended Consequences"
 balkfm.335.d: "The "sudden" killing of Smaïl-aga has not gone unanswered. [SCOPE.sCharacter('ali_pasha_scope').GetFirstName] #yellow Pasha#! has publicly denounced the murder and begun a campaign of punishment along the border. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has once again been put in a difficult position. With the threat of war escalating once more, [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('austria_scope')] have demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities."
 balkfm.335.f: "Ali Pasha has taken advantage of the turmoil caused by Smaïl-aga's murder. Since the plot remains unknown, the Bishop's options are limited without exposing the nature of the plot."

However, the Pasha has not hesistated to take his chance to gloat at the Montenegrin people."
 balkfm.336.f: ""My lord he has played us for fools!"\nThis sentiment has echoed across the Montenegrin court, as news arrived of the events that transpired immediately after negotiations concluded. Ali Pasha, arrogant in his diplomatic victory, had suddenly opened a bag of gold and threw several coins across the floor. In the ensuring rush, several members of our delegation threw themselves to the floor to gather as many as they could for themselves. This embarassing display has brought to light the sheer poverty of Montenegro in comparison to the rest of the Balkans."
 balkfm.336.a: "Never trust a Pasha."

 balkfm.337.d: "In turning a blind eye to the threat posed by [SCOPE.sCharacter('smail_aga_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow -aga#!, we have exposed ourselves to a far greater threat.

After running afoul of the Sultan with his ambitions, the Porte dispatched the vaunted [SCOPE.sCharacter('omar_pasha_scope').GetFirstName]#yellow Pasha#! [SCOPE.sCharacter('omar_pasha_scope').GetLastName] from the #o Military Frontier#! to restore central authority in the region."
 balkfm.339.f: "A direct and loyal man, #yellow Ömer Pasha Lütfi#! has already established himself as a capable commander capable of navigating the powderkeg that is the Balkans.

A sprawling poem, it is a shining example of Montenegrin epic poetry, taking the reader on a existential journey through creation. Heavily steeped in the tradition spawned by Milton's "Paradise Lost," the poem interprets the fate and future of humanity through a theological lens."
 balkfm.392.d2: "After months of work, #yellow Bishop#! has completed his work, #o Gorski vijenac#! (The Mountain Wreath). Written in the style of Montenegrin epic poetry, the work is a call to arms for Montenegro, rejecting the Islamization of his people. Drawing on folk tradition and wisdom, the Prince-Bishop has called for a greater awakening and unification of the Montenegrin Serbs."
 balkfm.392.d3: "After months of work, #yellow Bishop#! has completed his work, #o Lažni car Šćepan mali#! (The False Tsar Stephen the Little). Sarcastic and backhanded, the work is inspired by the life of Šćepan Mali, a pretender who took the Montenegrin throne by fabricating his identity as the deposed Tsar Peter III of Russia."
 balkfm.392.d4: "After months of work, #yellow Bishop#! has completed his work, #Ogledalo Srpsko#! (The Serbian Mirror). Structured as an anthology of Serbian folk tales, this compendium focuses on the stories of the heroic exploits of the Yugoslavs against the generational expansion of the Ottoman Empire."
 balkfm.392.f: ""We do not think that all his thoughts in this poem are dogmatically in harmony with the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, as for instance the pre-existence of Adam as the one [sic] of the great and leading angels, but poetry is poetry. The privilege of a poet consists in the freedom to add to the common reasoning his imagination which gives more life and color to the accepted facts. Negosh’s vision of the enormity of the created Universe in height, depth, width, and length; of many suns and galaxies of stars, ruled by various angelic hosts, is very striking. It reminds the reader of the Mount Palomar’s giant telescope, and the quite modern astronomic discoveries. There is no telescope which can beat the spirit and imagination of a great poet."-C. Manning, 1953"
