 balkfm.100.t: "The Eastern Question"
 balkfm.100.d: "There can be no doubt that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in decline. In the aftermath of conflicts with [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName], both the Caucasus and the Danubian Delta were torn away from the Empire and the Greek state gained its Independence. As nationalism spreads across the Empire, the Porte has found itself grappling with both internal strife and European encroachment."
 balkfm.100.f: "The [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')] is the poltical term used between the Great Powers to encapsulate the perception that the Ottoman Empire is doomed to collapse. Like vultures to a corpse, the Great Powers have begun efforts to enforce their designs for the Balkans onto the Ottoman state. While the Sublime Porte has remained defiant, there is little quesiton that the Turks cannot stand against the might of the European empires."

 balkfm.101.f: "Despite the lack of a centralized movement, the nations of the Balkans have turned their eyes to the West, hoping that further interventions by the imperialist powers will bring them freedom from the Porte."
 balkfm.101.a: "Freedom or death!"

 balkfm.102.t: "The Eastern Question"
 balkfm.102.d: "There can be no doubt that the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] is in decline. As the Ottoman state struggles to control its subjects, members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] diplomatic service have suggested that we may be able to gain a foothold into the Balkans by aiding and abeting the burdgeoning nationalist movements across the region."
 balkfm.102.f: "The Balkans were closed to the West for over four centuries following the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire. As the Ottoman state continues to backslide, the Great Powers have seized on the chance for diplomatic gains. However, many fear that the disintegration of the Empire may provoke economic turmoil."
 balkfm.102.a: "This is an opportunity."

 balkfm.300.t: "A Feudal Relic"
 balkfm.300.d: "For centuries, the Prince-Bishropic of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has succesfully resisted the tide of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]'s expansion across the Balkans. As the Porte attempts to dominate the Balkans, the young Prince-Bishop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], inspired by liberalism from the West, seeks to break the Montenegrin state from its feudal mould."
 balkfm.300.f: "While insulated from the Turkish domination of the Balkans, Montenegro is an impoverised, illiterate, and disorganized country. A relic of a bygone era, taxation is informal, justice is carried out by local lords, and there is little central authority."
 balkfm.300.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will find its way."
 balkfm.301.t: "The Battle of Grahovo"
 balkfm.301.d: "The Ottoman Pasha governing the Bosnian lands to our north has attacked the border village of Grahovo. Despite the efforts of the local militia, the village was ransacked and several civilians have been put to the sword. With the northern border poorly defined, political leaders fear that further Ottoman encroachment is imminent."

However, he has been received cooly by both the Tsar and his court."
 balkfm.302.f: "With the forces of the Porte bearing down on Montenegro, the Prince-Bishop has roused suspicion, both during his journey through Austria and on his arrival at the Russian court. Accused by both of "unmonkly" behavior, a rift has been growing between the feudal Austrian and Russian empires against South Slavic people who look to a future free from Ottoman feudalism."

 # Serbia Events
 balkfm.400.t: "Mileta's Rebellion"
 balkfm.400.d: "In the decades since achieving de facto independence from the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName], the Serbian state has been fractured by political infighting between Royalist and Constitutionalist factions. The Prince, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], has demanded societal reforms through absolutism, but has found himself opposed by supporters of [SCOPE.sCharacter('kaykay_scope').GetFullName] who have demanded limits to the power of the Throne."
 balkfm.400.f: "In the aftermath of two uprisings against the Sublime Porte, the Sultan granted an independent government to the Serbians, but kept them under Ottoman suzerainty. Like much of the Balkans, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is both rural and disorganized, dependent on the Great Powers for its continued existence against Ottoman reprisals. Prince [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is a war hero, but his demands for absolutist rule have estranged him from the people."
 balkfm.400.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will find its way."
 balkfm.401.t: "A Constitution Imposed"
 balkfm.401.d: "Prince [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] was loathe to convene the National Assembly to draft a constitution and has found ire with the document presented to both the Porte and the Great Powers. Under pressure from both the Assembly and foreign delegates, the Prince has signed the document and left the country, abdicating in the process. The new Prince, [SCOPE.sCharacter('milan_scope').GetFullName], while infirm and on his deathbed will soon ascend to the throne."

Sick with consumption when given the throne, he scarcely survived four weeks before giving up the ghost. His brother, [SCOPE.sCharacter('milhailo_scope').GetFullName] has been elected to sit at the throne instead.

 balkfm.500.t: "The Golden Lion Awakens" 
 balkfm.500.d: "Nearly a century of momentum built up in the National Awakening coupled with the decline of the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] has led to the rebirth of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. With the support of [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetRuler.GetFirstName], a Catholic Austrian prince has been elected to rule the fledgling nation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 balkfm.500.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is young and inexeperienced, and the country is in a precarious position. Not fully independent from the Porte, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is rural, destitute, and heavily dependent on diplomatic support from the [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state. Yet, the people feel hope for a future free of oppression and for future union with the Bulgarian people still living within Ottoman lands."
 balkfm.500.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will find its way."
 balkfm.501.t: "Democratic Obstructions"
 balkfm.501.d: "The Tarnovo Constitution is without question the most liberal constitution in the history if the Balkans. However, polticians have found their goals of nation-building disrupted by separatist agigators pandering to minority populations on the periphery of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 balkfm.501.f: "Bulgarians may be the majority in the Bulgarian state, but there are massive Greek, Turkish, and Macedonian minorities spread across the country. Seizing on the opportunity, grifters have stoked tensions between these groups at the expense of the young Bulgarian state."
 balkfm.501.a: "We must impose limitations on the press."
 balkfm.501.b: "The constitution must be sacrosanct."
 balkfm.502.t: "Conservative Pressure"
 balkfm.502.d: "Further challenges have arisen against the Tarnovo constitution. Prince [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has found his plans for rapidly developing the state apparatus dashed by the constant bickering of the National Assembly. With support from Russian diplomats, the Prince has proposed the abbrogation of large portions of the Constitution."
 balkfm.502.f: ""I think it possible, Monseigneur, that this enunciation of the theory of the State among the Slav races, or rather in Russia, may be of some advantage to you in your political plans." \n-J. Askakoff, in a letter to the Prince, 1881"

 balkfm.503.t: "An Absolute Monarch"
 balkfm.503.d: "In a series of rushed and poorly thought out acts, the National Assembly has effectively abolished any checks on the power of the Prince.

 balkfm.510.d: "Across the Balkans, brigands have pillaged both nobles and peasants alike. Community leaders have demanded the state provide a solution lest they fleece the entire country."
 balkfm.510.f: "The aftermath of the Greek War of Independence critically disrupted state control over the Balkan countryside. With the disintegration of Ottoman authority and economic stagnation, veterans have turned to brigandage to make a living."

 balkfm.511.t: "The End of the Brigands"
 balkfm.511.d: "Firm and decisive leadership from the state has led to the bandits ravaging our countryside putting down their weapons and taking up work as productive members of society."

 balkfm.511.a: "Justly done."
 balkfm.512.t: "Strategic Demands"
 balkfm.512.d: "The Treaty of Berlin established the limited Bulgarian state. Amongst its stipulations were requirements that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] establish a strategic rail network linking Turkish and Ottoman lands. Additionally, the British have imposed a demand that the state purchase the Rusé-Varna railway at an extortionate price."
 balkfm.512.f: "Since its inception, the Great Powers have hoped to position Bulgaria as a western beachhead in the Ottoman sphere. Despite desires to bring all aspects of transportation under state control, some fear this may compromise the Powers' support for the Bulgarian nation."

 balkfm.570.f: "The actions of the Bulgarian Exarchate, both in its establishment by firman of the Sultan and the later unilateral declaration of autocephaly, have caused outrage across the Orthodox world. Accusations have been made that the Bulgarian state has prioritized politics over the wellbeing of the faithful."

 balkfm.580.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may be reborn, but it exists only as a shadow of its full potential. To the west and south, our countrymen still live under the Ottoman thumb. Both the Prince and leaders in the National Assembly have demanded further concessions be made to the Bulgarian state."
 balkfm.580.f: "Historical Note: The 1878 Treaty of San Stefano had originally provided for extreme gains in favor of the newly formed Bulgarian state. Months later, the vast majority of these conquests were reversed in the Treay of Berlin which favored recognition of Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania. This left Bulgaria with only its lands north of the Balkan mountains and the remainder within East Rumelia with both under Ottoman suzerianty."

While only a personal union under the Monarch, this is the first step in restoring the Bulgarian state."
 balkfm.581.f: "While a momentous achievement, we must remain vigilant. The Tsar in Moscow and the Sultan in Constantinople will not take kindly to our interference in their designs."

The legal fiction binding us to the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName] has been cast to the wind."
 balkfm.582.f: "Since the Treaty of Berlin, the suzerianty of the Ottoman Empire has been little more than a pretentious illusion. The Bulgarian state has ruled itself with its own laws and customs, and the impotence of the Sultan's efforts to stop us are testament to that."
