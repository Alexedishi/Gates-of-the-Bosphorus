 grefm.001.d: "Welcome to the #bold Greece & Byzantium Flavor Mod#!! With this mod, you can guide [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] through its tumultuous years after gaining independence from the [SCOPE.sCountry('ottoman_scope').GetName]."
 grefm.001.f: "In the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence, the Greeks fell to infighting, unable to establish a centralized government over their newly won lands. After years of civil war, the Great Powers of [SCOPE.sCountry('france_scope').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName], and [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetName] installed a Bavarian Catholic ruler to govern over the reconstituted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is poor, rural, and dependent on the great powers. The young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], treads carefully, balancing his personal desires for absolutist rule with a need to appease the capricious whims of the Great Powers. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was accepted eagerly by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people, but every day that passes without reform and without prosperity steadily undermines his authority. Should Greece find its footing, it may even be able to confront the looming issue of the [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')]."
 grefm.001.f2: ""O King of Greece! Old Greece bequeathed the lights of learning to Germany, through you Germany has undertaken to repay the gift with interest, and will be grateful to you, seeing in you the one to resurrect the firstborn people of the Earth.""
 grefm.001.a: "Greece must find its way."
 grefm.002.t: "A Crisis Averted"
 grefm.002.d: "In the face of popular distrust and despite the machinations of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_landowners_scope').GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has implemented limitations on royal authority giving liberties to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. However, many continue to call for further reductions in the power and status of the nobility and the elevation of Greece into a beacon of hope for Greek peoples abroad."
 grefm.002.f: "We did not fight to overthrow our Turkish oppressors just to replace them with German ones."

 grefm.003.d: "Infuriated with the absent pace of reforms by the royal offices, [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName] has rallied the military and demanded the installation of a formal constitution to limit the power of the crown and grant rights to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.003.f: "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] arrived to take the Greek crown, many hoped he would bring an age of prosperity to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Instead, he has focused on ruling as an autocrat, against the will of the Greek people."
 grefm.003.a: "We must yield to the will of the people."
 grefm.003.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] will not be bullied by rabble."

 grefm.004.d: "Against the will of the people, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] has set into motion the establishment of an absolutist regime in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 grefm.005.f: ""King of the Hellenes! You have been a victim of men who, in order to undo the work of the Revolution and to restore the old regime of corruption, have not hesitated to traffic the people's reverence for the Crown and their devotion to your person. You have been the victim finally of your own quite human and not unnatural weakness. Accustomed to admire everything German, bewildered by the unrivalled German organization of military and other affairs of every sort, you not only expected a German victory, but you came to desire it, hoping that it would enable you to concentrate in your own hands all the authority of the government, and substantially to set aside our free Constitution.""
 grefm.005.a: "It is the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people!"
 grefm.006.t: "The October Revolution"
 grefm.006.d: "Despite his efforts to hold the throne, the German-born [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] has proven intolerable to both the people and aristocracy of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. In a sudden action, the military, led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName], has seized the capital and deposed the King. The deposed [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] has fled into exile to [SCOPE.sState('bavaria_state_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] with the help of [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] naval forces.

 grefm.008.b: "It is the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people!"
 grefm.009.t: "An Elected Monarch"
 grefm.009.d: "With the ousting of the Bavarian Monarchy, the custodian government has called for a plebsebite to determine the best candidate for the throne. However, this has proved problematic with the most popular candidates being unwilling or politically unable to take the crown. It has fallen to the caretaker government to appoint a new ruler."
 grefm.009.f: "The rulers of Greece vastly overestimated the value of the Greek crown to outsiders. Noble after noble passed on ruling the backwards nation. The most popular candidates were disqualified due to connections to the British, French, or Russian royal families."
 grefm.009.1: "The young lord, William of Denmark, will take the throne."

 grefm.010.t: "Constitutional Promises"
 grefm.010.d: "With the sluggish pace of reform, calls continue to grow across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for the enactment of a formal constitution."
 grefm.010.f: "When the regency council took custody of Greece for the young King, it was with the promise that a formal constitution would be established to define the limits of royal authority. Presently, the King rules with absolute authority with no structure in place to seek redress against abuses of power. The newly landed gentry have stonewalled attempts to limit their power and the King himself has shown no interest in accepting reform."
 grefm.010.a: "Something must be done."
 grefm.011.t: "An Ottoman Legacy"
 grefm.011.d: "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may be free from Ottoman rule, the underdeveloped government apparatus has left several relics of Turkish tax policy in place."
 grefm.011.f: "For nearly 400 years, the Greeks had been subject to the #italic timar#! system of land taxation that mostly impacts the poorest laborers. Derived from the Byzantine #italic pronoia#! system, this contributed to the decline of central authority in the Ottoman Empire which has been inherited by the fledgling Greek state. Coupled with a lack of intervention from the crown, nearly all of the Greek state's funding is drawn from the already destitute peasantry."
 grefm.011.a: "Unfortunate circumstances."
 grefm.012.t: "The Great Land Reformation"
 grefm.012.d: "With the reform of the land tax, a massive weight has been lifted from the Greek people."
 grefm.012.f: "The only way for Greece to attain prosperity is to shed these relics of oppression."
 grefm.012.a: "It is only fair."
 grefm.013.t: "Tribunal Justice"
 grefm.013.d: "Local leaders in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName] have executed several alleged brigands in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] following their arrest for brigandage. The informality of the legal process and brutality of the executions have drawn attention to the disorder in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.013.f: "Since the administration of Ioannis Kapodistrias, local cheiftains and irregular military units have ravaged the countryside. Descended from the armatoles of the Ottoman era, then called up during several failed insurrections against the regency, these would-be soldiers now refuse regular work. \n\nWithout support from the central government, many local leaders and landholders have turned to military tribunals to restore order. Thus far, this has been tolerated by the royal government, which has been more concerned with playing political factions against each other to prevent challenges to royal authority."
 grefm.013.a: "There must be a better way."
 grefm.014.t: "The End of the Brigands"
 grefm.014.d: "Firm and decisive leadership from the state has led to the bandits ravaging our countryside putting down their weapons and taking up work as productive members of society."
 grefm.014.f: "While a basic and mundane thing, ensuring the safety of our countrymen at home is an important step in legitimizing the state."
 grefm.014.a: "Justly done."
 grefm.015.t: "Rampant Corruption"
 grefm.015.d: "Prominent leaders within the government and the populace have called for the reform of the corrupt and dynastic nature of the government along with the inclusion of more Greek-native politicians in government."
 grefm.015.f: "Ever since independence, the majority of high-ranking positions in government have been filled by members of select noble families and personal friends of the King. The repeated sidelining of Greek politicians and divisions sown during the regency have left Greece with a government that lacks cohesion or motivation."
 grefm.015.a: "We will see what can be done."
 grefm.016.t: "An Honorable Regime"
 grefm.016.d: "The provision of elections for large portions of the government bureaucracy has dragged the government forward from the Ottoman's medieval legacy."
 grefm.016.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] may hem and haw, but the only way forward for Greece is to leave behind the trappings of absolutism."
 grefm.016.a: "For the good of the state."
 grefm.017.t: "Bavarian Forces Depart [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 grefm.017.d: "Bending to the calls of reformers, [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] has dismissed the Royal Bavarian Auxiliaries back to Bavaria."
 grefm.017.f: "While necessary to save the finances of the state, our army will take some time to reorganize itself with a fully-Greek officer corps." 
 grefm.017.a: "A Necessary Choice."
 
 grefm.020.t: "The Royal Bavarian Auxiliary Corps"
 grefm.020.d: "When King Otto arrived in 1832 he was accompanied by a force of 3500 Bavarian soldiers to solidify his rule. In the time since, they have found themselves unable to assimilate to life in Greece, speaking neither the language nor having access to the comforts of home the pervasively rural Greek state. With expenses mounting and their use in putting down rebellions, their presence wears on the Greek populace."
 grefm.020.f: ""The foreign auxiliary troops cost money, without doing much", while the "insistence on European clothing and armament in the army have removed the most usable people from military service and made them into disgruntled men." -Anton von Prokesch-Osten, Austrian Diplomat"
 grefm.020.a: "They serve at the pleasure of the King."
 
 grefm.030.t: "The Brigands Raid Again"
 grefm.030.d: "Brigands have raided the countryside in \n[SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName].
 grefm.030.f: "Disillusioned irregulars have seized on weak government control and police corruption to rob and pillage both laborer and gentry alike."
 grefm.030.a: "Godless Cowards."
 grefm.031.t: "A Perennial Problem"
 grefm.031.d: "Despite centralization of state authority, brigands have clung on as a force in the hilly borders with the Ottomans. In a brazen action, a band of raiders seized a group of nobles on holiday in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Despite efforts by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to negotiate a ransom, the group was viciously massacred following a misunderstanding between them and the envoys of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. International reactions have been harsh against both the state and the crown."
 grefm.031.f: ""We are moving on again. . . . We can see Evzones in front of us . . . we are lost. . ." -Mr Vyner, a nephew of Lord Grey of England."
 grefm.031.a: "This is a stain on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.031.tt: "Historical Note: In April of 1870, brigands took a group of aristocratic British travelers hostage. After negotiations were mishandled, they were murdered before Greek forces could apprehend the brigands. This badly damaged Greece's international standing and the peoples' confidence in the crown."
 
 grefm.040.t: "The King of the Hellenes"
 grefm.040.d1: "It was with great haste that a delegation was assembled by the National Assembly and dispatched to offer the crown to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]. Now, on his arrival in [SCOPE.sState('grefm_capital_scope').GetCityHubName], the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been greeted by cheers of jubilation for the hope of a second chance for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.040.d2: "With the Bavarian rule over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] secured, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been invested with the legitimacy of absolute power by the National Assembly."
 grefm.040.f: ""People of Greece, rejoice! Your troubles are at an end and our prayers have been heard! The dangers of Hellas are past, the ground has ceased to tremble, the earthquake has subsided before the edifice of the State was shaken to its foundation." - #italic Evnomia, May 24th#!"
 grefm.040.a: "All Hail [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_of_the_hellenes_scope').GetFullName]!"
 grefm.041.t: ""Who is to Blame?""
 grefm.041.d: "In keeping with their continual frustration with the monarchy, reformist [SCOPE.sCharacter('intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetFullName] has penned an inflammatory article denouncing the monarch as favoring his friends as prime ministers as opposed to politicians with genuine popular backing. The article has been seized upon by supporters and detractors as both a valid criticism of the Greek state and a grievous affront to the Crown." 
 grefm.041.f: ""If the people are not at fault, the politicians are at fault, others say, and the nation is responsible for their corruption, since they belong to the nation. We answer that the conduct of the statesmen would be the responsibility of the nation, if Greece were self-governing, but since through the perversion of the Constitution and the virtuality of the Parliament, Greece is indeed governed as an absolute monarchy, it was next that the statesmen whom the illegitimate regime propagates should also become at fault." -K. Trikoupis, 1874"
 grefm.041.a: "The Crown must take action."
 grefm.042.t: "A Harmonious State"
 grefm.042.d: "In accordance with the wishes of the National Assembly, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has granted assent to constitutional and procedural reforms curtailing the rights of the crown to appoint ministers without a majority in the assembly."
 grefm.042.f: ""Requiring as a necessary qualification of those invited to join the local government the trust expressed to them by the majority of the representatives of the nation, I accept that the Parliament makes possible the existence of this qualification, without which the harmonious functioning of the state is impossible." -George I, 1875"
 grefm.042.a: ""Zito Vasilévs ! Zito Vasilevka !—Zito, zito !""
 grefm.043.t: ""Unfortunately, We are Bankrupt""
 grefm.043.d: "In a nationally embarrassing show of incompetence, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s leaders have managed to bankrupt the nation. Despite this, several politicians have put togther a series of plans to restore our financial credibility."
 grefm.043.f: "Historical Note: Following an ambitious career marked by overspending and #italic a lot#! of corruption, Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis stood before Parliament and gave the most famous statement of his career. Or maybe he didn't. This quote isn't actually included in the minutes of the Parliamentary session in question."
 grefm.043.a: "We must reorganize our finances."
 grefm.043.b: "Cancel foreign debts."
 grefm.044.t: "The Military League"
 grefm.044.d: "Emulating historical nationalist revolutions, a small, but determined, group of eager young officers have formed a radical faction within the National Assembly.  This has spiraled into malcontent amongst the military who have formed the "Military League" and demanded the removal of all royal influence in the military. Many have gone as far as to strike up republican tones."
 grefm.044.f: "While ranging from across the political spectrum, the participants in the Military League were inspired by an earlier faction, the "Japanese Group" named in reference to the Meiji reformers. While the "Japanese" took up an anti-oligarchy stance, the Military league has maintained a strong meritocracy stance. Both have ended up fanning the flames of anti-monarchism."
 grefm.044.a: "Maybe they have some good points."
 grefm.044.b: "They should know their place.
 grefm.045.t: "A Cretan Champion"
 grefm.045.d: "As the Military League continues to gather power and make direct threats to the monarchy, a relatively unknown politician, [SCOPE.sCharacter('grefm_venizelos_scope').GetFullName], has arrived in [SCOPE.sState('grefm_capital_scope').GetCityHubName] with a bold plan: playing on his popularity as a leader in the Cretan struggle, the man intends to take the reigns of power and push through a mixture of concessions and liberal reforms to appease the Military League."
 grefm.045.f: ""After I finished my studies in Athens I returned home and hung out my bandolier. I had not tried many cases in the court of my home island before it became necessary for me to take up arms against the Turkish government. Although my father was born in Greece, I was considered an Ottoman subject —therefore a rebel— because my mother was born under the Turkish flag....I soon reached the point where I had to decide whether I ought to be a lawyer by profession and a revolutionary at intervals or a revolutionary by profession and a lawyer at intervals ... I naturally became a revolutionary by profession." - E. Venizelos, 1919"
 grefm.045.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will finally have strong leadership."

 grefm.046.d: "Fed up with the endless squabbles with the monarchy, the Military League has seized control of the SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetName] and ousted the Royal family from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. With the nation under their control they have set up a military junta with the stated goal of enforcing Greek superiority over the Hellespont."

 grefm.046.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will finally have strong leadership."
 grefm.047.t: "Absolutism in Greece"
 grefm.047.d: "As the trials and tribulations of the early Bavarocrat rule fade into distant memory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been hailed as the backbone of the Greek state. As power centralizes ever more around the royal court, the people pray for their future prosperity."
 grefm.047.f: "It was the young lord of House Wittelsbach that brought peace to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It is only right that they retain the authority to rule."

 grefm.050.d: "Riding a wave of popular support, [SCOPE.sCharacter('grefm_venizelos_scope').GetFullName] has taken the reigns of government and begun a wild flurry of reforms that aim to shake the Greek state to its core. Backed by the will of the people and the uneasy support of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will be a herald of change in the East."
 grefm.050.f: ""...I gave the opinion that the Army should devote itself to the urgent task of reorganizing the country's military forces and at the same time I gave the Revolution the advice to demand and impose the convening of a Revisionist Parliament, which would proceed with the revision of those provisions of the Constitution, the need for reform of which was demonstrated by the experience of almost half a century...." - E.

 grefm.100.t: "The Fix Brewery"
 grefm.100.d: "In newly independent Greece, several Bavarian nobles accompanied King Otto and settled throughout Attica, bringing with them their penchant for beer. To compete with the import of beers from Bavaria, Johann Karl Fix has established a brewery in the state of Athens to cater to the needs of the elites."
 grefm.100.f: "Historical Note: Johann Adam Fix began brewing beer during the regency of King Otto which he found to be immensely lucrative. After securing his position as the supplier of beer to King George I, his son, Johann Karl Fix, opened the Fix Brewery which would go on to develop a stranglehold on the Greek beer market through the 1960s."

 grefm.102.f: "Historical Note: On 8 February 1912, Argyropoulos was the first Greek to perform a flight over his home country. A second flight conducted that same day, with then Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, convinced state leaders of the need for a Hellenic Air Force."

 grefm.110.t: "The Decline of the Heptanese School"
 grefm.110.d: "Ever since Greek independence, the great art schools of the Ionian Islands have been declining as artists explore abroad. A royal commission has suggested that the state set up a Royal Art School to attract Greek artists."
 grefm.110.f: "In the centuries since the Fall of Constantinople, artists on the Ionian Islands have kept alive the Byzantine artistic tradition. With an independent Greek state and influence from Italian and French artists, many artists have begun a shift towards Romanticism and away from the restrictive style of Byzantine art."
 grefm.110.a: "This is a noble endeavor."

 grefm.111.t: "The Kopais Plain"
 grefm.111.d: "With advances in Greek engineering, land surveyors have suggested that the state may be able to reclaim fertile lands currently submerged beneath Lake Kopais in Attica."
 grefm.111.f: "Historical Note: Lake Kopais was once drained by the Mycenaneans over 3000 years ago in what was an incredible feat of prehistoric engineering. The lake refilled as their stoneworks failed over the millennia. Villagers along the banks of the lake frequently complain of flooding and high water tables during heavy inflows into the lake."

 grefm.113.t: "A Citadel Emerges"
 grefm.113.d: "As the waters of Lake Kopais recede, researchers have taken note of a raised outcropping into the lake.

Born in Crete and educated in Athens, she launched the #italic Ephemeris ton kyrion#!, which was run entirely by women and served as a springboard for spreading the message of feminism across Greece. She attended several international conferences and founded several welfare organizations dedicated to forwarding the cause of women. However, she would not directly support women's suffrage which she worried would be too radical for Greece at the turn of the century."
 grefm.124.t: "Greek League for Women's Rights"
 grefm.124.d: "The movements ignited by Kalliroi Parren have borne fruit with the elevation of the status of women beyond housewives. Furthermore, limitations on child labor have given the Greek state a chance at bettering the lives of the lower classes. As restrictions on the speech of women are peeled away, several leaders call for further reforms, including equality in marriage and suffrage."
 grefm.124.f: "Historical Note: Following the first wave of women's rights reforming throughout the late 1800s, feminist Avra Theodoropoulou founded the Greek League for Women's Rights which expressly championed the cause of women's suffrage. This cause would eventually succeed in two phases: first in 1930 for literate women, and second in 1952 for all women.

 grefm.142.f: "The ancient citadel sprawls across an outcrop that juts far into former Lake Kopais. Measuring larger then the footprint of ancient Athens, the site is defined by two major features: a palace-like structure in the north and two warehouse-like structures in the south.

 grefm.143.t: "Acropolis of Athens Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d: "Ephors have announced the completion the enormous project to clear and catalogue the site at the Acropolis. Amongst the piles of discarded bricks and stones, over a dozen unique sites have been identified throughout the hilltop. Most prominent among these is the Parthenon, an ancient monument-treasury and later church, that currently hosts a mosque at its heart."
 grefm.143.f: "Dating as far back as the Mycenaean period, the Acropolis has been built over and repurposed countless times over the millennia. Several temples, sanctuaries, and gateways dot the site, each having found new uses under successive regimes to the modern day."

 grefm.144.t: "Parthenon Site Excavated"
 grefm.144.d: "The abandoned mosque has been demolished and the site cleared at the Parthenon. Under the supervision of Architect Nikolaos Balanos, the shattered remains of the Parthenon have been identified and reassembled using iron and concrete for structural reinforcement."
 grefm.144.f: "Historical Note: The first restoration of the Parthenon was a monumental achievement for the Archaeological Service.

 grefm.145.f: "Historical Note: Until the formal excavations at Knossos, the role of Crete in the Minoan civilization was unclear. With the discovery of the palace complex, the city's position at the heart of the Minoan Civilization was confirmed. Excavations would continue from 1900-1931 with several phases of restorations.

 grefm.230.t: "The Tomos of Autocephaly"
 grefm.230.d: "In 1833, during the regency of King Otto, a commission of both laymen and clerics advised the young King to declare the Orthodox Church independent of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, then under the control of the Ottoman Sultans. After decades of dialogue, faith leaders have come to reached a compromise: the Ecumenical Patriarch has decreed that, while nominally subject to Constantinople, the Greek Orthodox Church will be free to control the worship within the Greek state."
 grefm.230.f: ""Together, we acknowledge her and proclaim her our spiritual sister, and to the most pious and Orthodox children of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, as a church, we pray that you will be recognized and remembered as such under the name "Holy Synod of the Church of Greece"; the privileges and all the sovereign rights of the supreme ecclesiastical authority witnessing, so that the rest is remembered by the High Priests in Greece in their own provinces of priests, of the President of this commemorating all Orthodox Diocese, and grant the canonical editions required for the ordination of High Priests.""
 grefm.230.a: "The King shall be our spiritual protector."
 grefm.230.a.tt: "#italic This is the historical choice. In 1850, a royal decree and statutory law established a Synod with members appointed by the King and of which the King was its head.#!"
 grefm.230.b: "We cannot superimpose the church with the state."
 
 grefm.240.t: "What is a Greek?"
 grefm.240.d: "The debate of Greek identity, inflamed by both Enlightenment Ideals and the birth of the Greek State, has reached a fever pitch amongst intellectuals in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Centering around what defines a "Greek," intellectuals have emphasized commonalities such as the Greek language and the Orthodox church as delimiters of Greek nationality over state boundaries."
 grefm.240.f: "During the Byzantine era, Greeks often defined themselves along two lines: firstly they called themselves both "Greek" and "Roman;" secondly, they emphasized their identity as Christians. This identity became even more important in the Ottoman era where, without a state of their own, their culture survived by a shared experience of language and religion through various stages of acceptance and persecution by their Ottoman overlords. Combined with Slavic and Arab intrusions into formerly Greek lands, the idea of a continuous Greek population since ancient times has been challenged by scholars and politicians both before and after the Greek Revolution."
 grefm.240.a: "But we have always been Greek."
 grefm.241.t: "The Language Question"
 grefm.241.d: "Since independence, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_intelligentsia_scope').GetName] has pushed for the adoption of a variety of Greek called #italic Katharevousa#!. Cultivated in the 1700s, this dialect has been "purged" of non-Greek words and is common in scholarly and royal communication. The people continue to use #italic demotic#!, or vulgar, Greek, with each region having its own local variation of the Greek language. Concurrently, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_devout_scope').GetName] continues to use #italic Khoine Greek#!, a liturgical dialect with continuity back to the Hellenistic period."
 grefm.241.f: "Historical Note: The problem of which dialect of Greek to promote to national status was a heavily debated issue up to 1976. For millennia, the Greek language has existed along a continuum, like most languages before the advent of modern schooling and nation-states. The arrival of the Seljuk Turks carved physical divisions between various Greek populations, allowing many dialects to diverge to a point of being nearly unintelligible to each other."
 grefm.241.a: "Our language will bind us together."
 grefm.242.t: "A National Language"
 grefm.242.d: "Through academic rigor and the will of the state, national leaders are ready to organize a national curriculum for the Greek language. While this won't resolve the language problem overnight, we can at least ensure a consistent linguistic education for our children across the Greek state."
 grefm.242.f: "As the Greek literary landscape grows, Katharevousa has been disproportionately favored by writers and politicians alike. Many fear that further pushing the Greek language backwards in time will only further alienate the populace and impede education access for the masses. Conversely, many hold that purifying the language of Slavic and Turkish "contamination" will allow educators to refine the otherwise uncouth masses."
 grefm.242.a: "Demotic Greek is the true language of the people."
 grefm.242.b: "Katharevousa will cement a Greek identity."
 grefm.242.c: "Khoine Greek is the only truly Greek language."
 grefm.243.t: "Defining Greek Roots"
 grefm.243.d: "The large strides made by the Archaeological Society have given the Greek people a sense of presence in the Balkans back into prehistoric times. Every month, more of the people speak of the Greek state as if it has existed through the eras, going as far as conflating the modern state with the Byzantine and Roman administrations that preceded the Ottomans."
 grefm.243.f: "Thanks to our scholars, we can say without question that the "proto-Greeks" arrived in the Balkans well before recorded history and have been here ever since. Be they in the hands the pre-Roman city-states, the Byzantine Empire, or the Venetian and Ottoman oppressors, these land have been and always will remain Greek."
 grefm.243.a: "We have always been here."
 grefm.249.t: "The Greek Ethnogenesis"
 grefm.249.d: "Nobody could tell you when it happened, but everybody knew it happened: day-in and day-out the people are proud to walk Greek streets, to work Greek jobs, and to coexist with their Greek neighbors. From its beginning as a disunified and crumbling post-Turkish state, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and her people have risen to stand as a true nation-state."
 grefm.249.f: ""For how long, o brave young men, shall we live in fastnesses,\nAlone, like lions, on the ridges in the mountains?\nShall we dwell in caves, looking out on branches,\nFleeing from the world on account of bitter serfdom?\nAbandoning brothers, sisters, parents, homeland\nFriends, children, and all of our kin?\n\nBetter one hour of free life,\nThan forty years of slavery and prison."\n\n -R.

 grefm.251.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('crete_owner_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] governor of [SCOPE.sState('crete_state_scope').GetName] has been accused of demanding unreasonable taxes of Greek citizens, far beyond the usual jizya imposed by the [SCOPE.sCountry('crete_owner_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."

 grefm.251.f: "While the Greeks enjoyed tolerable conditions for most of their time under Ottoman rule, this waxed and waned depending on the policies of each given sultan. However, matters worsened after the formation of the Greek State and most Greeks found themselves the targets of political and social reprisals."
 grefm.251.a: "He is merely exercising his authority."
