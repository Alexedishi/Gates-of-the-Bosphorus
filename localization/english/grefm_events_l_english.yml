 grefm.001.t: "The Bavarocracy & The Greek State"
 grefm.001.d: "In the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence, the Greeks fell to infighting, unable to establish a centralized government over their newly won lands. After years of civil war, the Great Powers of [SCOPE.sCountry('france_scope').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName], and [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetName] installed a Bavarian Catholic ruler to govern over the reconstituted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 grefm.001.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is poor, rural, and dependent on the great powers. The young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], treads carefully, balancing his personal desires for absolutist rule with a need to appease the capricious whims of the Great Powers. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was accepted eagerly by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people, but every day that passes without reform and without prosperity steadily undermines his authority. Should Greece find its footing, it may even be able to confront the looming issue of the [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')]."
 grefm.001.f2: ""O King of Greece! Old Greece bequeathed the lights of learning to Germany, through you Germany has undertaken to repay the gift with interest, and will be grateful to you, seeing in you the one to resurrect the firstborn people of the Earth." -P. Soutsos, 1837"
 grefm.001.a: "Greece must find its way."
 grefm.002.t: "A Crisis Averted"
 grefm.002.d: "In the face of popular distrust and despite the machinations of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_landowners_scope').GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has implemented limitations on royal authority giving liberties to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. However, many continue to call for further reductions in the power and status of the nobility and the elevation of Greece into a beacon of hope for Greek peoples abroad."
 grefm.002.f: "We did not fight to overthrow our Turkish oppressors just to replace them with German ones."

 grefm.003.d: "Infuriated with the absent pace of reforms by the royal offices, [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName] has rallied the military and demanded the installation of a formal constitution to limit the power of the crown and grant rights to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.003.f: "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] arrived to take the Greek crown, many hoped he would bring an age of prosperity to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Instead, he has focused on ruling as an autocrat, against the will of the Greek people."

 grefm.005.d: "In the face of the Great Powers that supported Greek independence, the Greek people have abolished the monarchy."
 grefm.005.f: ""King of the Hellenes! You have been a victim of men who, in order to undo the work of the Revolution and to restore the old regime of corruption, have not hesitated to traffic the people's reverence for the Crown and their devotion to your person. You have been the victim finally of your own quite human and not unnatural weakness. Accustomed to admire everything German, bewildered by the unrivalled German organization of military and other affairs of every sort, you not only expected a German victory, but you came to desire it, hoping that it would enable you to concentrate in your own hands all the authority of the government, and substantially to set aside our free Constitution.""

In a sudden action, the military, led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName], has seized the capital and deposed the King. The deposed [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] has fled into exile to [SCOPE.sState('bavaria_state_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] with the help of [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] naval forces.

 grefm.009.t: "An Elected Monarch"
 grefm.009.d: "With the ousting of the Bavarian Monarchy, the custodian government has called for a plebsebite to determine the best candidate for the throne. However, this has proved problematic with the most popular candidates being unwilling or politically unable to take the crown. It has fallen to the caretaker government to appoint a new ruler."
 grefm.009.f: "The rulers of Greece vastly overestimated the value of the Greek crown to outsiders. Noble after noble passed on ruling the backwards nation. The most popular candidates were disqualified due to connections to the British, French, or Russian royal families."

 grefm.009.7.tt: "#purple A descendant of House Palaiologos shall ascend to the throne#!." 
 
 grefm.010.t: "Constitutional Promises"
 grefm.010.d: "When the regency council took custody of Greece for the young King, it was with the promise that a formal constitution would be established to define the limits of royal authority. Presently, the King rules with absolute authority with no structure in place to seek redress against abuses of power. The newly landed gentry have stonewalled attempts to limit their power and the King himself has shown no interest in accepting reform."
 grefm.010.f: ""...but as it is today, 1835, the Greek state with a limited area, with population thinning, poverty, homelessness and foreign regency, how can it to hope for its rapid development and for future prosperity and progress? The leader and administrator of our public affairs, a foreigner, however good and loyal he may be, will seek his individual advantage above all else and will strive with all his might to establish an independent and proud existence in his country from our sweat and intolerance, because according to natural reason, he can have no other sympathy in favor of his (foreign) land, but that of individual interest." -L. Kountouriotis , 1835"
 grefm.010.a: "Something must be done."
 grefm.011.t: "An Ottoman Legacy"
 grefm.011.d: "Despite freedom from Ottoman rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s underdeveloped government apparatus has left several relics of Turkish tax policy in place. Coupled with a lack of intervention from the crown, nearly all of the Greek state's funding is drawn from the already destitute peasantry."
 grefm.011.f: ""...agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition. Even in the immediate neighborhood of Athens it is common to find the wooden plow and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago. Fields are plowed up or scratched over, and crops replanted season after season, until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Irrigation is in use in some districts, and, as far as I can ascertain, the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled; but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation." -W. Moffet, American Consul in Athens, 1889"
 grefm.011.a: "Unfortunate circumstances."
 grefm.012.t: "The Great Land Reformation"
 grefm.012.d: "With the reform of the land tax, a massive weight has been lifted from the Greek people."
 grefm.012.f: "The only way for Greece to attain prosperity is to shed these relics of oppression."
 grefm.012.a: "It is only fair."
 grefm.013.t: "Tribunal Justice"
 grefm.013.d: "Local leaders in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName] have executed several alleged brigands in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] following their arrest for brigandage. The informality of the legal process and brutality of the executions have drawn attention to the disorder in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.013.f: "Since the administration of Ioannis Kapodistrias, local cheiftains and irregular military units have ravaged the countryside. Descended from the armatoles of the Ottoman era, then called up during several failed insurrections against the regency, these would-be soldiers now refuse regular work. \n\nWithout support from the central government, many local leaders and landholders have turned to military tribunals to restore order. Thus far, this has been tolerated by the royal government, which has been more concerned with playing political factions against each other to prevent challenges to royal authority."
 grefm.013.a: "There must be a better way."
 grefm.014.t: "The End of the Brigands"
 grefm.014.d: "Firm and decisive leadership from the state has led to the bandits ravaging our countryside putting down their weapons and taking up work as productive members of society."
 grefm.014.f: "While a basic and mundane thing, ensuring the safety of our countrymen at home is an important step in legitimizing the state."
 grefm.014.a: "Justly done."
 grefm.015.t: "Rampant Corruption"
 grefm.015.d: "Ever since independence, the majority of high-ranking positions in government have been filled by members of select noble families and personal friends of the King. The repeated sidelining of Greek politicians and divisions sown during the regency have left Greece with a government that lacks cohesion or motivation. Prominent leaders have called for the reform of the corrupt and dynastic nature of the government along with the inclusion of more Greek-native politicians in government."
 grefm.015.f: ""...transition of the Viceroyalty to the country of its temporary residence and the beginning of its governmental duties, flocked, as a follow-up to it, and especially from Bavaria, a flock of drones who did not have universal virtues and the true enthusiasm for our common things, as those in in favor of our independence, self-styled philhellenes, occupied public positions with the favor and protection of the new power and took, so to speak, the bread of existence from the mouths of the Greek fighters." -P. Papanaoum, 1851"
 grefm.015.a: "We will see what can be done."
 grefm.016.t: "An Honorable Regime"
 grefm.016.d: "The provision of elections for large portions of the government bureaucracy has dragged the government forward from the Ottoman's medieval legacy."
 grefm.016.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] may hem and haw, but the only way forward for Greece is to leave behind the trappings of absolutism."
 grefm.016.a: "For the good of the state."
 grefm.017.t: "The Royal Bavarian Auxiliary Corps"
 grefm.017.d: "When King Otto arrived in 1832 he was accompanied by a force of 3500 Bavarian soldiers to solidify his rule. In the time since, they have found themselves unable to assimilate to life in Greece, speaking neither the language nor having access to the comforts of home the pervasively rural Greek state. With expenses mounting and their use in putting down rebellions, their presence wears on the Greek populace."
 grefm.017.f: ""The foreign auxiliary troops cost money, without doing much", while the "insistence on European clothing and armament in the army have removed the most usable people from military service and made them into disgruntled men." -Anton von Prokesch-Osten, Austrian Diplomat"
 grefm.017.a: "They serve at the pleasure of the King." 
 grefm.018.t: "Bavarian Forces Depart [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 grefm.018.d: "Bending to the calls of reformers, [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] has dismissed the Royal Bavarian Auxiliaries back to Bavaria."
 grefm.018.f: "While necessary to save the finances of the state, our army will take some time to reorganize itself with a fully-Greek officer corps." 
 grefm.018.a: "A Necessary Choice."
 grefm.019.t: "The Return of the "Turk-Eater""
 grefm.019.d: "In a supreme act of celemency, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has pardoned #gold Nikitaras#! from his imprisonment and charged him with aid in the defense of the nation. A famed fighter during the Greek War of Independence, he was known for his aggressive actions towards Turkish soldiers, earning him the nickname "Turkophagos" or "Turk-Eater." Armed with a sword and pardons for previously speaking out against the regency, our rivals would do well to fear him."
 grefm.019.f: ""I have only my sword, and that I gladly give for my country." -N. Stamatelopoulos, 1826" 
 grefm.019.a: "He will serve [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] well."
 
 grefm.020.t: "The Brigands Raid Again"
 grefm.020.d: "Brigands have raided the countryside in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName], renewing cries for state action."
 grefm.020.f: "Disillusioned irregulars have seized on weak government control and police corruption to rob and pillage both laborer and gentry alike. Withdrawing as quickly as they arrived, local chieftans have found several villages raided and burned."
 grefm.020.a: "Godless Cowards."
 grefm.021.t: "A Perennial Problem"
 grefm.021.d: "Despite centralization of state authority, brigands have clung on as a force in the hilly borders with the Ottomans. In a brazen action, a band of raiders seized a group of nobles on holiday in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Despite efforts by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to negotiate a ransom, the group was viciously massacred following a misunderstanding between them and the envoys of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. International reactions have been harsh against both the state and the crown."
 grefm.021.f: ""We are moving on again. . . . We can see Evzones in front of us . . . we are lost. . ." -Mr. Vyner, a nephew of Lord Grey of England."
 grefm.021.a: "This is a stain on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.021.tt: "Historical Note: In April of 1870, brigands took a group of aristocratic British travelers hostage. After negotiations were mishandled, they were murdered before Greek forces could apprehend the brigands. This badly damaged Greece's international standing and the peoples' confidence in the crown."
 grefm.022.t: "Absolutism in Greece"
 grefm.022.d: "As the trials and tribulations of the early Bavarocrat rule fade into distant memory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been hailed as the backbone of the Greek state. As power centralizes ever more around the royal court, the people pray for their future prosperity."
 grefm.022.f: "It was the young lord of House Wittelsbach that brought peace to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It is only right that they retain the authority to rule."
 grefm.022.a: "Hail to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]!"
 
 grefm.030.t: "The King of the Hellenes"
 grefm.030.d1: "It was with great haste that a delegation was assembled by the National Assembly and dispatched to offer the crown to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]. Now, on his arrival in [SCOPE.sState('grefm_capital_scope').GetCityHubName], the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been greeted by cheers of jubilation for the hope of a second chance for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.030.d2: "With Bavarian rule over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] secured, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been invested with the legitimacy of absolute power by the National Assembly."
 grefm.030.f: ""People of Greece, rejoice! Your troubles are at an end and our prayers have been heard! The dangers of Hellas are past, the ground has ceased to tremble, the earthquake has subsided before the edifice of the State was shaken to its foundation." - #italic Evnomia, May 24th#!"
 grefm.030.a: "All Hail [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_of_the_hellenes_scope').GetFullName]!"
 grefm.031.t: ""Who is to Blame?""
 grefm.031.d: "In keeping with their continual frustration with the monarchy, reformist [SCOPE.sCharacter('intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetFullName] has penned an inflammatory article denouncing the monarch as favoring his friends as prime ministers as opposed to politicians with genuine popular backing. The article has been seized upon by supporters and detractors as both a valid criticism of the Greek state and a grievous affront to the Crown." 
 grefm.031.f: ""If the people are not at fault, the politicians are at fault, others say, and the nation is responsible for their corruption, since they belong to the nation. We answer that the conduct of the statesmen would be the responsibility of the nation, if Greece were self-governing, but since through the perversion of the Constitution and the virtuality of the Parliament, Greece is indeed governed as an absolute monarchy, it was next that the statesmen whom the illegitimate regime propagates should also become at fault." -K. Trikoupis, 1874"
 grefm.031.a: "The Crown must take action."
 grefm.032.t: "A Harmonious State"
 grefm.032.d: "In accordance with the wishes of the National Assembly, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has granted assent to constitutional and procedural reforms curtailing the rights of the crown to appoint ministers without a majority in the assembly."
 grefm.032.f: ""Requiring as a necessary qualification of those invited to join the local government the trust expressed to them by the majority of the representatives of the nation, I accept that the Parliament makes possible the existence of this qualification, without which the harmonious functioning of the state is impossible." -George I, 1875"
 grefm.032.a: ""Zito Vasilévs ! Zito Vasilevka !—Zito, zito !""
 grefm.033.t: ""Unfortunately, We are Bankrupt""
 grefm.033.d: "In a nationally embarrassing show of incompetence, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s leaders have managed to bankrupt the nation. Despite this, several politicians have put togther a series of plans to restore our financial credibility."
 grefm.033.f: "Historical Note: Following an ambitious career marked by overspending and #italic a lot#! of corruption, Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis stood before Parliament and gave the most famous statement of his career.

 grefm.100.d: "In newly independent Greece, several Bavarian nobles accompanied King Otto and settled throughout Attica, bringing with them their penchant for beer. To compete with the import of beers from Bavaria, Johann Karl Fix has established a brewery in the state of Athens to cater to the needs of the elites."
 grefm.100.f: "Historical Note: Johann Adam Fix began brewing beer during the regency of King Otto which he found to be immensely lucrative. After securing his position as the supplier of beer to King George I, his son, Johann Karl Fix, opened the Fix Brewery which would go on to develop a stranglehold on the Greek beer market through the 1960s."

 grefm.103.t: "Merchantile Traditions"
 grefm.103.d: "Ever since their arrival in the Balkans in the late neolithic, the Greek cultures have had a stranglehold on maritime trade across the Aegean Sea. So great was the wealth of the Greek shipping magnates that they provided the material support that would give rise to the #italic Diafotismos#!, Greek Enlightenment, and from there, the Greek Revolution."
 grefm.103.f: "While the Greeks held maritime supremacy in the Aegean throughout history, Ottoman rule saw Greek merchants take on a power of their own. From the 16th to the 18th century, trade in the Eastern Mediterraean came under Greek domination as a result of the jockeying between Great Britain, France, and Russia."

 grefm.110.f: "In the centuries since the Fall of Constantinople, artists on the Ionian Islands have kept alive the Byzantine artistic tradition. With an independent Greek state and influence from Italian and French artists, many artists have begun a shift towards Romanticism and away from the restrictive style of Byzantine art."

 grefm.111.f: "Historical Note: Lake Kopais was once drained by the Mycenaneans over 3000 years ago in what was an incredible feat of prehistoric engineering. The lake refilled as their stoneworks failed over the millennia. Villagers along the banks of the lake frequently complain of flooding and high water tables during heavy inflows into the lake."

 grefm.112.f: ""They had learned later from my German friend, Ziegler, an engineer officer in Greece, that the Bavarians were pinning their hopes on the plan to drain Lake Kopais. Firstly, that from these expenses generated by the public during the work of that great enterprise, their benefit would not be negligible and secondly, the slower production from the cultivated lands of Kopaida would fill their pockets." -P.

 grefm.123.b: "These women should focus themselves on their households."
 grefm.123.tt: "Historical Note: Kalliroi Parren is widely seen as the founder of the feminist movement in Greece. Born in Crete and educated in Athens, she launched the #italic Ephemeris ton kyrion#!, which was run entirely by women and served as a springboard for spreading the message of feminism across Greece. She attended several international conferences and founded several welfare organizations dedicated to forwarding the cause of women. However, she would not directly support women's suffrage which she worried would be too radical for Greece at the turn of the century."
 grefm.124.t: "Greek League for Women's Rights"
 grefm.124.d: "The movements ignited by Kalliroi Parren have borne fruit with the elevation of the status of women beyond housewives. Furthermore, limitations on child labor have given the Greek state a chance at bettering the lives of the lower classes. As restrictions on the speech of women are peeled away, several leaders call for further reforms, including equality in marriage and suffrage."
 grefm.124.f: "Historical Note: Following the first wave of women's rights reforming throughout the late 1800s, feminist Avra Theodoropoulou founded the Greek League for Women's Rights which expressly championed the cause of women's suffrage. This cause would eventually succeed in two phases: first in 1930 for literate women, and second in 1952 for all women. Feminist efforts would gradually turn women from silent housewives to active participants in the development of Greek nationalism."

 grefm.142.f: "The ancient citadel sprawls across an outcrop that juts far into former Lake Kopais. Measuring larger then the footprint of ancient Athens, the site is defined by two major features: a palace-like structure in the north and two warehouse-like structures in the south. Scholars have theorized that the entire site may have served as a temporary shelter in times of war or hardship."

 grefm.143.t: "Acropolis of Athens Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d: "Ephors have announced the completion the enormous project to clear and catalogue the site at the Acropolis. Amongst the piles of discarded bricks and stones, over a dozen unique sites have been identified throughout the hilltop. Most prominent among these is the Parthenon, an ancient monument-treasury and later church, that currently hosts a mosque at its heart."
 grefm.143.f: "Dating as far back as the Mycenaean period, the Acropolis has been built over and repurposed countless times over the millennia. Several temples, sanctuaries, and gateways dot the site, each having found new uses under successive regimes to the modern day."
 grefm.143.a: "Excellent work."
 grefm.144.t: "Parthenon Site Excavated"
 grefm.144.d: "The abandoned mosque has been demolished and the site cleared at the Parthenon. Under the supervision of Architect Nikolaos Balanos, the shattered remains of the Parthenon have been identified and reassembled using iron and concrete for structural reinforcement."
 grefm.144.f: "Historical Note: The first restoration of the Parthenon was a monumental achievement for the Archaeological Service. However, the techniques used by Balanos have been heavily criticized. Balanos' techniques of drilling into the marble and replacing lead sealants with concrete ended up causing severe and irreversible damage to the ruins over the next century."

 grefm.145.t: "Knossos Surveyed"
 grefm.145.d: "Building on the initial discovery of the site by Minos Kalokairinos in the 1870s, a team has uncovered an enormous throne room at the heart of a Bronze Age Palace. Further work has uncovered the sprawling remains of palace complex and ancient urban site."
 grefm.145.f: "Historical Note: Until the formal excavations at Knossos, the role of Crete in the Minoan civilization was unclear. With the discovery of the palace complex, the city's position at the heart of the Minoan Civilization was confirmed. Excavations would continue from 1900-1931 with several phases of restorations. Today, the site is within a short distance of Heraklion."
 grefm.145.a: "Incredible."
 grefm.146.t: "Minoan Palace Restored"
 grefm.146.d: "With the aid of Englishman Arthur Evans, laborers have completed an extensive reconstruction of the palace and its associated buildings. Several chambers and frescoes have been painstakingly rebuilt, with artisans blending the modern repair work with the ancient aesthetics."
 grefm.146.f: "Historical Note: While impressive, the "reconstitution" of the palace has been criticized as Evans applied a large amount of creative license to his reconstructions, sometimes added embellishments that weren't attested or worse later proven to be incorrect."
 grefm.146.a: "Excellent news!"
 grefm.147.t: "Delos Surveyed"
 grefm.147.d: "With the island abandoned since Byzantine times and managed only by a small caretaker population, the "excavations" at Delos have been more of just an accounting of the various structures located at the site. Several temples and social centers survive in remarkable condition."
 grefm.147.f: "Situated amongst the Cyclades, Delos was the mythological core of the Aegean Sea. The term Cyclades itself means "encircling" which indicates how the ancient Greek conceptualized the relationship between Delos and its surrounding islands."
 grefm.147.a: "Wonderful."
 grefm.148.t: "Larissa Surveyed"
 grefm.148.d: "After exhaustive efforts, the Archaeological Service has detailed several ruins and structures that dot the city. As lists are distributed to local officials, the hope is that urban planners can avoid disruption of known ancient sites."

 grefm.240.d: "The debate of Greek identity, inflamed by both Enlightenment Ideals and the birth of the Greek State, has reached a fever pitch amongst intellectuals in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Centering around what defines a "Greek," intellectuals have emphasized commonalities such as the Greek language and the Orthodox church as delimiters of Greek nationality over state boundaries."
 grefm.240.f: "During the Byzantine era, Greeks often defined themselves along two lines: firstly they called themselves both "Greek" and "Roman;" secondly, they emphasized their identity as Christians. This identity became even more important in the Ottoman era where, without a state of their own, their culture survived by a shared experience of language and religion through various stages of acceptance and persecution by their Ottoman overlords. Combined with Slavic and Arab intrusions into formerly Greek lands, the idea of a continuous Greek population since ancient times has been challenged by scholars and politicians both before and after the Greek Revolution."

 grefm.241.t: "The Language Question"
 grefm.241.d: "Since independence, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_intelligentsia_scope').GetName] has pushed for the adoption of a variety of Greek called "Katharevousa". The people continue to use "Demotic", or vulgar, Greek, with each region having its own local variation of the Greek language. Concurrently, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_devout_scope').GetName] continues to use "Khoine" Greek, a liturgical dialect with continuity back to the Hellenistic period."
 grefm.241.f: "Historical Note: The problem of which dialect of Greek to promote to national status was a heavily debated issue up to 1976. For millennia, the Greek language has existed along a continuum, like most languages before the advent of modern schooling and nation-states. The arrival of the Seljuk Turks carved physical divisions between various Greek populations, allowing many dialects to diverge to a point of being nearly unintelligible to each other."

 grefm.242.t: "A National Language"
 grefm.242.d: "Through academic rigor and the will of the state, national leaders are ready to organize a national curriculum for the Greek language. While this won't resolve the language problem overnight, we can at least ensure a consistent linguistic education for our children across the Greek state."
 grefm.242.f: "As the Greek literary landscape grows, Katharevousa has been disproportionately favored by writers and politicians alike. Many fear that further pushing the Greek language backwards in time will only further alienate the populace and impede education access for the masses. Conversely, many hold that purifying the language of Slavic and Turkish "contamination" will allow educators to refine the otherwise uncouth masses."
 grefm.242.a: "Demotic Greek is the true language of the people."

 grefm.243.d: "The large strides made by the Archaeological Society have given the Greek people a sense of presence in the Balkans back into prehistoric times. Every month, more of the people speak of the Greek state as if it has existed through the eras, going as far as conflating the modern state with the Byzantine and Roman administrations that preceded the Ottomans."
 grefm.243.f: "Thanks to our scholars, we can say without question that the "proto-Greeks" arrived in the Balkans well before recorded history and have been here ever since. Be they in the hands the pre-Roman city-states, the Byzantine Empire, or the Venetian and Ottoman oppressors, these land have been and always will remain Greek."
 grefm.243.a: "We have always been here."
 grefm.244.t: "The History of the Greek Nation"
 grefm.244.d: "Following decades of academic rigor, Constantine Paparrigopoulos has published the last volume of his work #italic History of the Hellenic Nation#!. A remarkably vivid and elegant accounting of Greek history, his work is the first to thread together the histories of ancient Greece, medieval Greece, and the modern Greek state into a marvelous story of Greek presence across the Balkans and Anatolia."
 grefm.244.f: "Historical note: Published in six volumes from 1860 to 1877, Paparrigopoulos' work was the first truly academic attempt to rebut the mainstream opinion that the Greek "race" had been displaced or assimilated by various Slavic peoples during the migration period with a complete disregard towards nearly a millennium of Byzantine domination of the Hellespont followed by a complex existence as an integral part of the fabric of the Ottoman state."

 grefm.251.d2: "The governor has been recalled, but [SCOPE.sCountry('crete_owner_scope').GetName] has provided no guarantees against future abuses."
 grefm.251.f: "While the Greeks enjoyed tolerable conditions for most of their time under Ottoman rule, this waxed and waned depending on the policies of each given sultan. However, matters worsened after the formation of the Greek State and most Greeks found themselves the targets of political and social reprisals."
