 grefm.001.f: "In the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence, the Greeks fell to infighting, unable to establish a centralized government over their newly won lands. After years of civil war, the Great Powers of [SCOPE.sCountry('france_scope').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('russia_scope').GetName], and [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetName] installed a Bavarian Catholic ruler to govern over the reconsituted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is poor, rural, and dependent on the great powers. The young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], treads carefully, balancing his personal desires for absolutist rule with a need to apease the capricous whims of the Great Powers. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was accepted eagerly by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people, but every day that passes without reform and without prosperity steadily undermines his authority. Should Greece find its footing, it may even be able to confront the looming issue of the [Concept('concept_eastern_question','$concept_eastern_question$')]."
 grefm.001.f2: ""O King of Greece! Old Greece bequeathed the lights of learning to Germany, through you Germany has undertaken to repay the gift with interest, and will be grateful to you, seeing in you the one to resurrect the firstborn people of the Earth.""
 grefm.001.a: "Greece must find its way."
 grefm.002.t: "A Crisis Averted"
 grefm.002.d: "In the face of popular distrust and despite the machinations of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_landowners_scope').GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has implemented limitations on royal authority giving liberties to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. However, many continue to call for further reductions in the power and status of the nobility and the elevation of Greece into a beacon of hope for Greek peoples abroad."
 grefm.002.f: "We did not fight to overthrow our Turkish oppressors just to replace them with German ones."

 grefm.003.f: "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] arrived to take the Greek crown, many hoped he would bring an age of prosperity to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Instead, he has focused on ruling as an autocrat, against the will of the Greek people."

You have been a victim of men who, in order to undo the work of the Revolution and to restore the old regime of corruption, have not hesitated to traffic the people's reverence for the Crown and their devotion to your person. You have been the victim finally of your own quite human and not unnatural weakness. Accustomed to admire everything German, bewildered by the unrivalled German organization of military and other affairs of every sort, you not only expected a German victory, but you came to desire it, hoping that it would enable you to concentrate in your own hands all the authority of the government, and substantially to set aside our free Constitution.""
 grefm.005.a: "It is the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people!"

In a sudden action, the military, led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName], has seized the capital and deposed the King. The deposed [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] has fled into exile to [SCOPE.sState('bavaria_state_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] with the help of [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] naval forces.

 grefm.008.b: "It is the will of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people!"
 grefm.009.t: "An Elected Monarch"
 grefm.009.d: "With the ousting of the Bavarian Monarchy, the custodian government has called for a plebsebite to determine the best cadidate for the throne. However, this has proved problematic with the most popular candidates being unwilling or politically unable to take the crown. It has fallen to the caretaker government to appoint a new ruler."
 grefm.009.f: "The rulers of Greece vastly overestimated the value of the Greek crown to outsiders. Noble after noble passed on ruling the backwards nation. The most popular candidates were disqualified due to connections to the British, French, or Russian royal families."

 grefm.010.t: "Constitutional Promises"
 grefm.010.d: "Calls continue to echo across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for the enactment of a formal consitution."
 grefm.010.f: "When the regency council took custody of Greece for the young King, it was with the promise that a formal constitution would be established to define the limits of royal authority. Presently, the King rules with absolute authority with no structure in place to seek redress against abuses of power. The newly landed gentry have stonewalled attempts to limit their power and the King himself has shown no interest in accepting reform."
 grefm.010.a: "Something must be done."
 grefm.011.t: "An Ottoman Legacy"
 grefm.011.d: "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may be free from Ottoman rule, the underdeveloped government apparatus has left several relics of Turkish tax policy in place."
 grefm.011.f: "In its formation, Greece inherited several elements of Ottoman government. For nearly 400 years, the Greeks had been subject to the near-feudal system of land taxation that mostly impacts the poorest laborers. Coupled with a lack of foreign investment, nearly all of the state's funding is drawn from the already desitute peasantry."
 grefm.011.a: "Unfortunate circumstances."
 grefm.012.t: "The Great Land Reformation"
 grefm.012.d: "With the reform of the land tax, a massive weight has been lifted from the Greek people."

 grefm.012.a: "It is only fair."
 grefm.013.t: "Tribunal Justice"
 grefm.013.d: "Local leaders in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName] have executed several alleged brigands in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] following their arrest for brigandage. The informality of the legal process and brutality of the executions have drawn attention to the disorder in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.013.f: "Since the administration of Ioannis Kapodistrias, local cheiftains and irregular military units have ravaged the countryside. Called up during several failed insurrections against the regency, these would-be soldiers now refuse regular work. \n\nWithout support from the central government, many local leaders and landholders have turned to military tribunals to restore order. Thus far, this has been tolerated by the royal government, which has been more concered with playing politican factions against each other to prevent challenges to royal authority."
 grefm.013.a: "There must be a better way."
 grefm.014.t: "The End of the Brigands"
 grefm.014.d: "Firm and decisive leadership from the state has led to the bandits ravaging our countryside putting down their weapons and taking up work as productive members of society."
 grefm.014.f: "While a basic and mundane thing, ensuring the safety of our countrymen at home is an important step in legitmizing the state."
 grefm.014.a: "Justly done."
 grefm.015.t: "Rampant Corruption"
 grefm.015.d: "Prominent leaders within the government and the populace have called for the reform of the corrupt and dynastic nature of the government along with the inclusion of more Greek-native politicans in government."
 grefm.015.f: "Ever since independence, the majority of high-ranking positions in government have been filled by members of select noble families and personal friends of the King. The repeated sidelining of Greek politicians and divisions sown during the regency have left Greece with a government that lacks cohesion or motivation. "
 grefm.015.a: "We will see what can be done."
 grefm.016.t: "An Honorable Regime"
 grefm.016.d: "The provision of elections for large portions of the government bureaucracy has dragged the government forward from the Ottoman's medieval legacy."
 grefm.016.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] may hem and haw, but the only way forward for Greece is to leave behind the trappings of absolutism."
 grefm.016.a: "For the good of the state."
 
 grefm.030.t: "The Brigands Raid Again"
 grefm.030.d: "Brigands have raided the countryside in \n[SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName].
 grefm.030.f: "Disillusioned irregulars have seized on weak government control and police corruption to rob and pillage both laborer and gentry alike."
 grefm.030.a: "Godless Cowards."
 
 grefm.200.t: "The Greek State"
 grefm.200.d: "The rise of nationalism has created an irredentist desire among our citizens to incorporate all the lands of the [SCOPE.sCulture('greek_culture_scope').GetName] people under a single Greek state."
 grefm.200.f: ""We have cast aside centuries of Ottoman rule to bring the Greek state into being. Yet it is not enough. Many of our countrymen still live under the oppressive yoke of foreign rule, yearning for a country they can call their own. This dream can only be realized through the annexation of all the Greek lands, which we will achieve with or without the consent of their occupiers.""
 grefm.200.a: "Our claim to this land is irrefutable."
 grefm.200.b: "Expansion is not a priority for now."
 grefm.201.t: "The Megali Idea"
 grefm.201.d: "The expansion of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state has led some of the most fervent nationalists to propose an even more ambitious project: the restoration of the Byzantine Empire through the conquest of formerly [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] lands."
 grefm.201.f: ""That which yesterday would have seemed an absurd pipe dream is now within our grasp. The purple phoenix will rise again!""
 grefm.201.a: "Byzantium will be restored."
 grefm.201.e: "We will carve a path for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 grefm.201.b: "We should celebrate what we have already achieved."

 grefm.202.t: "The Future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 grefm.202.d: "With the conquest of lands across the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, the goals of the Great Idea have come to fruition. Our citizens now look to the state to lead them into a new era."

 grefm.202.a: "We will raise the Imperial standard once more!"

 grefm.202.c: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will live forever!"
 grefm.203.t: "The Fate of the Turks"
 grefm.203.d: "With Anatolia an integral part of the Empire, the question has been raised of what to do with the remnant Turkish peoples present across our lands."
 grefm.203.f: "Despite occupying and dominating the former Byzantine lands for over 400 years, the Ottomans tolerated the presence of the Orthodox worshipers amongst them. The state must decide which future awaits them."
 grefm.203.a: "Just as we co-existed with them, the Turks will coexist with us."
 grefm.203.b: "We are a Greek Empire for the Greek people."
 grefm.204.t: "A Question of Homelands"
 grefm.204.d: "As we establish control over our former lands, the question of what to do with the Turkish populations within [SCOPE.sState('turkish_homeland_state').GetName] has come to a head once more."
 grefm.204.f: "While originating from the steppes, the Turkic peoples across Anatolia feel few, if any, connections to their ancestral home. The majority would even argue that Anatolia #italic is#! their home. Regardless, irredentist leaders assert Greek primacy in these lands."
 grefm.204.a: "These are Greek lands."
 grefm.204.b: "[SCOPE.sState('turkish_homeland_state').GetName] will serve as a reservation."
 grefm.205.t: "Greek Expansion in [SCOPE.sState('grefm_expansion_state').GetName]"

 grefm.205.f: "The Greek world once extended from the Carpathians to the Hindu Kush. Anatolia is but a small part of this greater whole."
