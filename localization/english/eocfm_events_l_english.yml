 eocfm.001.t: "The Bishops of the East"
 eocfm.001.d: "As the world enters a new age, scholars and state leaders have begun to debate the role of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetStateReligion.GetName] Church within the state. Some push for full state control of the Church, like the Byzantines and Russians, while others advocate a more hands-off approach, with fears that such influence might invite a new form of oppression like that of the Ottomans."
 eocfm.001.f: "The Eastern Orthodox traditon has diverged heavily from the Roman Catholic tradition in the West. Having rejected the primacy of Rome in Church affairs, the Orthodox Church is led by five Partiarchs, four at the Ancient Seats of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, with a fifth seated in Moscow. However, with the rise of Nationalism, states have sought increased control over ecclesiastical affairs."
 eocfm.001.a: "God willing, we will prevail."

 eocfm.003.t: "The Holy Synod of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 eocfm.003.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is an Orthodox nation, yet it is ruled by a Catholic King and infested with Protestant missionaries. The faithful themselves are overseen by the Greek Orthodox Church, led by the Greek Synod. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] strikes a careful balance, leaving the synod to its business, but retaining a final veto over their decisions."
 eocfm.003.f: "Historical Note: Almost immediately after taking the throne, the regency council unilaterally declared the church in Greece to be autocephalous, considering the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople to be little more than a pawn of the Sultan. This would be the first of many unilateral moves by national churches to break away from Constantinople as a method of asserting their national identity and insulating themselves from meddling by the Ottoman state."
 eocfm.003.a: "We are an Orthodox nation."
 eocfm.004.t: "The Most Holy Synod"
 eocfm.004.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown to become the largest and most influential of the Patriarchates of the Eastern Church. With a jurisdiction that now reaches from the banks of the Black Sea in Europe to the Yukon Mountains in North America, Russian Emperors have sought to dominate the Orthodox Church."
 eocfm.004.f: "Historical note: In the centuries following the Fall of Constantinople, several political and relgious leaders have argued that Moscow is the successor to the Roman Empire and thus the one true leader of the Christian World. While this has remained unrecognized in this role by other Patriarchs and Christianity at large, Emperors have this to assert influence over Orthodox Christians. In 1774, the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca gave Russia nominal control over the Greek Orthodox communities in the Ottoman Empire, and Nicholas I would spend much of his rule asserting Russian primacy in Eastern Orthodox affairs across the Ottoman state."
 eocfm.004.a: ""Oriental affairs are above all a matter for Russia.""

 eocfm.010.t: "Ecumenical Reforms"
 eocfm.010.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church is the one true successor to the Great Church founded by Jesus Christ. Yet, with its decentralized structure, deviations have developed between the various churches over the centuries. A cohort of bishops have requested state support in implementing some liturgical changes in the interest of better aligning ourselves with the rest of the Orthodox family."
 eocfm.010.f: "Historical note: With the ebb and flow of Patriarchal influence over the church at large, minor differences have developed within the Orthodox church that have often led to minor schisms. Examples include the Old Believer movement originating in 1650s Russia and the more recent Old Calendarist movement in 1920s Greece."
 eocfm.010.a: "They will have state backing."
 eocfm.010.b: "We will not abandon our traditions."
 eocfm.011.t: "Bible Translation Published"
 eocfm.011.d: "The faithful in [SCOPE.sState('eocfm_event_state').GetName] are in an uproar over a plan by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_scope').GetName] to publish a translation of the Holy Book in Common [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting]."
 eocfm.011.f: ""Who amongst the peasants and the workers, who even among the merchants and the clerks and all those who have not completed secondary education can understand the language of the Gospels? No one." -Akropolis, published 9 September 1901"
 eocfm.011.a: "Let the faithful read!"
 eocfm.011.b: "This is an insult to the divine word!"

 eocfm.012.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is an [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] nation, yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] follows the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetReligion.GetName] faith. Vocal church leaders have suggesting that it is high time the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] put the good of the nation before his personal matters and join the church."
 eocfm.012.f: "The Eastern Orthodox Church has held sway over the Balkans and Asia Minor since the time of the Romans. However, in the intervening centuries, both Catholicism and Protestantism have risen in the West. This has clashed with local nations who have found themselves led by non-Orthodox sovereigns imposed upon them by the Great Powers."
 eocfm.012.a: "The royal family will join the Church."
 eocfm.012.b: "We will compromise with the heir, [SCOPE.sCharacter('eocfm_heir_scope').GetFirstName]."

 eocfm.020.t: "Commissioning an Icon"
 eocfm.020.d: "At the direction of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], bishops from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_scope').GetName] have presented several options for the dissemination of state-sponsored icons to churches throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Each one promises to inspire the faithful."
 eocfm.020.f: "The tradition of Iconography in the Eastern Churches can be traced back to the early Christian church as it transitioned to becoming the state religion of the Roman Empire. Developed and maintained in relative isolation from the traditions in the West, the styles and motifs of icons is a hallmark of the Eastern Orthodoxy."

 eocfm.031.d: "While the Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been a vital pillar of our cultural identity, senior clergymen have suggested that the inclusion of state-appointed priests is diluting the holiness of the Church."
 eocfm.031.f: "Historical Note: Dating back to Byzantine times, many positions within Church leadership were appointed by the state. This practice was additionally normalized under both Turkish and Russian rule. However, this practice often risked damaging the credibility of the clergy and kept the Church open to political meddling."

 eocfm.040.f: "While the people broadly support the Church, many have taken issue with this worldly display of wealth. Critics argue that this money is better spent on improving living conditions for the impovershed or on supporting remote monasteries."

 eocfm.102.d: "During the regency of King Otto, a commission of laymen and clerics advised the young King to declare the Orthodox Church independent of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. After years of debate, the Ecumenical Patriarch has decreed that the Greek Orthodox Church will oversee worship within the Greek state."

 eocfm.125.f: "With the rise of nationalism throughout the Balkans and the Near East, several peoples have sought religious services given in their own language by priests of their culture. This has resulted in an overlap of preistly jurisdictions, as bishops attempt to assert their control over their prescribed districts, while still reaching out to minority populations of their culture.

 eocfm.126.f: ""Both you (Greeks) and the Bulgarians can equally be accused of phyletism, that is, of introducing ethnic interests into Church questions, and in the use of religion as a political weapon; but the difference lies in the fact that Bulgarian phyletism is defensive, while yours is offensive.

 eocfm.127.d: "In response to increasing exposure to the West, several Orthodox countries have begun to adopt the Gregorian Calendar to simplify their interactions in trade and diplomacy. This has prompted a divisive debate within the Church, which continues to use the Julian Calendar."
 eocfm.127.f: "Proposed by Julius Caesar over a millennium and a half ago, the Julian Calendar replaced the Roman lunisolar calendar. In 1582, Gregory XIII issued an updated calendar to correct for drift from the solar year. While widely adopted across Europe and North America, the Orthodox Church has refused to adopt this change."

 eocfm.128.d2: "In a rebuke to the liberalizing pressure from the West, the Ecumenical Council has rejected any notion of making any changes to the Julian calendar, considering it tantamount to adopting the Gregorian calendar, itself a heretical symbol of the West."
