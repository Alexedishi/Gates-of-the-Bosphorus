 eocfm.001.t: "The Bishops of the East"
 eocfm.001.d: "As the world enters a new age, scholars and state leaders have begun to debate the role of the Orthodox Church within the state. Some push for full state control of the Church, like the Byzantines and Russians, while others advocate a more hands-off approach, with fears that such influence might invite a new form of oppression like that of the Ottomans."
 eocfm.001.f: "The Eastern Orthodox traditon has diverged heavily from the Roman Catholic tradition in the West. Having rejected the primacy of Rome in Church affairs, the Orthodox Church is led by five Partiarchs, four at the Ancient Seats of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, with a fifth seated in Moscow. However, with the rise of Nationalism, states have sought increased control over ecclesiastical affairs."
 eocfm.001.a: "God willing, we will prevail."
 eocfm.002.t: "Church-State Relations"
 eocfm.002.d: "While the Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been a vital pillar of our cultural identity2 senior  have suggested that the inclusion of state-appointed clergy is diluting the holiness of the Church."
 eocfm.002.f: "Historical Note: Dating back to Byzantine times, many positions within Church leadership were appointed by the state. This practice was additionally normalized under both Turkish and Russian rule. However, this practice often risked damaging the credibility of the clergy and kept the Church open to political meddling."
 eocfm.002.a: "Let the Church be."
 eocfm.002.b: "The State will have primacy."
 eocfm.003.t: "Ecumenical Reforms"
 eocfm.003.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church is the one true successor to the Great Church founded by Jesus Christ. Yet, with its decentralized structure, deviations have developed between the various churches over the centuries. A cohort of bishops have requested state support in implementing some liturgical changes in the interest of better aligning ourselves with the rest of the Orthodox family."
 eocfm.003.f: "Historical note: With the ebb and flow of Patriarchal influence over the church at large, minor differences have developed within the Orthodox church that have often led to minor schisms. Examples include the Old Believer movement originating in 1650s Russia and the more recent Old Calendarist movement in 1920s Greece."
 eocfm.003.a: "They will have state backing."
 eocfm.003.b: "We will not abandon our traditions."
 eocfm.004.t: "Bible Translation Published"
 eocfm.004.d: "The faithful in [SCOPE.sState('eocfm_event_state').GetName] are in an uproar over a plan by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligenstia_scope').GetName] to publish a translation of the Holy Book in Common [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting]."

 eocfm.020.d: "At the direction of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], bishops from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_scope').GetName] have presented several options for the dissemination of state-sponsored icons to churches throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Each one promises to inspire the faithful."
 eocfm.020.f: "The tradition of Iconography in the Eastern Churches can be traced back to the early Christian church as it transitioned to becoming the state religion of the Roman Empire. Developed and maintained in relative isolation from the traditions in the West, the styles and motifs of icons is a hallmark of the Eastern Orthodoxy."

 eocfm.031.f: "Ever since the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans, overall seniority over the Eastern Church has swung back and forth between Constantinople and Moscow, with intermittent assertions of independence by the other Ancient Partiarchates. With the rise of Nationalism, this has been further complicated as states seek to break free from Greek dominance over the Church."

 eocfm.100.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] National Synod"
 eocfm.100.d: "The Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has called a synod of all senior bishops within the state. They ask for support from the state in guiding the nation in faith independently from the established Partiarchates."
 eocfm.100.f: "Historical note: During the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, newly independent nations often sought to assert national identities by claiming religious independence from the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Russia. This often took the form of national synods that would "declare" the national church autocephalous before seeking recognition from the other Patriarchs."
 eocfm.100.a: "The Nation cannot survive without the Church."
 eocfm.100.b: "They are on their own." 
 eocfm.101.t: "The Most Holy Synod"
 eocfm.101.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown to become the largest and most influential of the Patriarchates of the Eastern Church. With a jurisdiction that now reaches from the banks of the Black Sea in Europe to the Yukon Mountains in North America, Russian Emperors have sought to dominate the Orthodox Church."
 eocfm.101.f: "Historical note: In the centuries following the Fall of Constantinople, several political and relgious leaders have argued that Moscow is the successor to the Roman Empire and thus the one true leader of the Christian World. While this has remained unrecognized in this role by other Patriarchs and Christianity at large, Emperors have this to assert influence over Orthodox Christians. In 1774, the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca gave Russia nominal control over the Greek Orthodox communities in the Ottoman Empire, and Nicholas I would spend much of his rule asserting Russian primacy in Eastern Orthodox affairs across the Ottoman state."
 eocfm.101.a: ""Oriental affairs are above all a matter for Russia.""
 eocfm.102.t: "The Holy Synod of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 eocfm.102.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is an Orthodox nation, yet it is ruled by a Catholic King and infested with Protestant missionaries. The faithful themselves are overseen by the Greek Orthodox Church, led by the Greek Synod. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] strikes a careful balance, leaving the synod to its business, but retaining a final veto over their decisions."
 eocfm.102.f: "Historical Note: Almost immediately after taking the throne, the regency council unilaterally declared the church in Greece to be autocephalous, considering the Ecumenical Partiarch in Constantinople to be little more than a pawn of the Sultan. This would be the first of many unilateral moves by national churches to break away from Constantinople as a method of asserting their national identity and insulating themselves from meddling by the Ottoman state."

 eocfm.111.t: "The Tomos of Autocephaly"
 eocfm.111.d: "In 1833, during the regency of King Otto, a commission of both laymen and clerics advised the young King to declare the Orthodox Church independent of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, then under the control of the Ottoman Sultans. After decades of dialogue, faith leaders have come to reached a compromise: the Ecumenical Patriarch has decreed that, while nominally subject to Constantinople, the Greek Orthodox Church will be free to control the worship within the Greek state."
 eocfm.111.f: ""Together, we acknowledge her and proclaim her our spiritual sister, and to the most pious and Orthodox children of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, as a church, we pray that you will be recognized and remembered as such under the name "Holy Synod of the Church of Greece"; the privileges and all the sovereign rights of the supreme ecclesiastical authority witnessing, so that the rest is remembered by the High Priests in Greece in their own provinces of priests, of the President of this commemorating all Orthodox Diocese, and grant the canonical editions required for the ordination of High Priests." -Tomos dated 29 June 1850"

 eocfm.300.d: "Church bells ring and people cheer as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] declares the rebirth of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Beneath the imposing presence of the [SCOPE.sBuilding('hagia_sofia_scope').GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been adorned with reconstructions of the old sigils and regalia of the Partiarchs of Constantinople. Stepping forward towards the array of citizens, dignitaries, and clergy, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands as a beacon for the future of the Greek people."
 eocfm.300.f: "Where countless attempts failed over the centuries since the losses of Rome and Constantinople, the Empire stands resurgent today. However, much work remains: numerous Greeks are ruled by heretics and heathens, formerly Roman lands remain within the grasp of foreign pretenders, and countless Byzantine treasures are kept hostage abroad. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] must be sure to live up to the expectations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] subjects if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is to bring glory to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

It falls to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to determine the future of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 eocfm.301.f: ""The Kingdom of Greece is not Greece; it is merely a part: the smallest, poorest part of Greece. The Greek is not only he who inhabits the Kingdom, but also he who inhabits Ioannina, Salonika or Serres or Adrianople or Constantinople or Trebizond or Crete or Samos or any other region belonging to the Greek history or the Greek race... There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the dream and hope of all Greeks." -I. Kolettis, 1844"

 eocfm.304.d: "Our conquests have finally rescued the cradle of Christendom after over a millennium of oppression. Now, the Patriarchs work diligently to restore the churches shuttered during Muslim rule. After debates and deliberations, the Patriarch of Constantinople along with the other Patriarchs of the East have called for a new crusade against the heathens that still threaten our borders, this time without the treacherous armies of the Pope in the West."
 eocfm.304.f: ""For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her." -Canon XXVIII, Council of Chalcedon, 451"
