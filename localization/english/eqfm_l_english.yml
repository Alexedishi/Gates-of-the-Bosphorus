 je_eqfm_crisis_main_reason: "The Ottoman Empire is in crisis. Beset with problems from within and without, the Porte struggles to maintain control over the Empire. As nationalism sweeps the country, the state's non-Turkish subjects have begun to resort to armed uprisings with the goal of establishing governments free of Ottomn influence.\n\nLikewise, the European powers have taken advantage of the military and economic stagnation of the Empire to impose their will upon the Sultan.
